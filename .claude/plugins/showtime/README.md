## Quick start

**1. Install the two prerequisites** (details in [Requirements](#requirements)):
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 24 or 22 LTS (20 or newer works).
Restart your coding agent afterwards so it sees them.

**2. Add showtime to your agent.** In Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add FavioVazquez/showtime
/plugin install showtime@showtime
```

Using Codex, Cursor, Devin, OpenCode or another agent? [Works with](#works-with) has the exact
install for each, and `npx skills add FavioVazquez/showtime` covers any agent that supports Agent Skills.

**3. Ask for a video:**

```text
Make a 20-second launch video for this repo, with a voice-over and upbeat music.
```

The first time, your agent checks what is missing, tells you the download size and time (about
0.6 to 0.8 GB into `~/.showtime`, depending on your system, usually 2 to 6 minutes; nothing outside that
folder changes) and runs setup once you say yes. Bigger pieces (the transcription model, Manim, music
tracks) come the first time a video needs them, announced with their size. After that, a request in Claude
Code looks like this:

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/readme/terminal-dark.svg">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/readme/terminal-light.svg">
    <img alt="A Claude Code session: the request is typed, Claude states its assumptions (quick mode, 20 s, 16:9, English voice, upbeat bed, only claims the README makes), shows a first look, renders on this machine, and showtime prints its completion card: final.mp4 is ready, 20.0 s, 1920x1080, 17.0 MB, qa PASS, the output path and the next step." src="assets/readme/terminal-light.svg" width="100%">
  </picture>
  <br><sub>An illustration of a session in Claude Code; other agents show the same steps in their own style. The card's figures are example 01's; render time depends on your machine.</sub>
</p>

Your agent states its assumptions in one line (it asks only when a request is genuinely open), shows you a
first look (stills or a fast draft) before the full-quality render, then checks the result with
`showtime qa`. Every request gets its own folder, `showtime-out/<name>-<timestamp>/`, with `final.mp4`,
`poster.jpg`, `share.txt`, `exports/` and `work/`. Nothing is ever overwritten.

> [!TIP]
> Say **"show me options first"** (or "studio") and your agent opens a local board where you pick a concept,
> a look, a music bed and a storyboard before anything is built. Say **"no crew"** to keep the whole job in
> one session.

**What's new in 0.3.0** (the full list is [below](#new-in-030)):

- **A full review on every video, and quieter runs.** Each finished video gets looks, qa and a critic round before
  delivery; say "lean" for a lighter pass. Commands print a short verdict and keep the detail in a file, references
  are read by the piece (`showtime guide`), and looks at frames go to a disposable reviewer, so less piles up in your
  agent's context.
- **Videos that differ from each other.** A local look history warns when a video repeats a recent one, and
  `showtime reference` learns pace and type scale from a video you like, never its content.
- **Checks for what viewers complain about.** A phone check (text you can read at phone size, held long enough),
  and pairwise review, where a new version ships only if the critic prefers it in both orders.
- **New kinds of video.** Repo and paper explainers, release and PR videos (`showtime release-video`, and a GitHub
  Action), launches that start from your product's real brand, and `showtime adopt` for video code you already have.
- **A receipt for every job:** your request as typed, the rounds, renders and time, and tokens and cost where your
  agent reports them.

In my blind vote in [benchmark](#benchmark) round 4, 0.3.0 in lean mode was preferred to 0.2.0 on 4 of 6 tasks and to
plain Claude Code on 7 of 8; the full-review default came after that round and was not part of it.

## Works with

showtime is a skill, a command line and an MCP server, so it runs in any coding agent that reads
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) and can run shell commands. MCP adds typed tools on top, and
the ten [crew](#meet-the-crew) agents are an optional speed-up for hosts that have custom sub-agents.

**Tested with.** A real run passed: the agent installed showtime from this repository and made a
5-second test video ("make a 5-second test video that says hello", empty folder), ending in a `final.mp4`
whose `showtime qa` verdict had no FAIL.

| Agent | Install route | Crew agents | Tested with |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Claude Code](#claude-code) | plugin | yes | the primary host |
| [OpenAI Codex](#other-agents) | plugin | with `showtime install` | CLI 0.158.0, plugin route |
| [Cursor](#other-agents) | plugin (reads `.claude-plugin/`) | yes | CLI 2026.09.28 |
| [Devin](#other-agents) | plugin (reads `.claude-plugin/`) | yes (local only) | CLI 3000.11.3 |
| [OpenCode](#other-agents) | `showtime install` | yes | 1.18.33, a free model |

**Should work with** any agent that supports [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io): GitHub Copilot
(CLI and VS Code), Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cline, Kilo Code, Kiro, Zed, Goose, Amp, Factory Droid and Qwen
Code. The files each one reads are packaged and were checked with the agent's own tools where possible, but
no real video has been made in them yet. If you try one, an [issue](https://github.com/FavioVazquez/showtime/issues)
with what happened helps everyone. Exact steps for every agent, and what the tests covered:
[docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md).

### Claude Code

```text
/plugin marketplace add FavioVazquez/showtime
/plugin install showtime@showtime
```

Everything is included: the skill, the ten crew agents, the MCP server and the plugin settings (`/config`).

### Any agent that supports Agent Skills

```bash
npx skills add FavioVazquez/showtime
```

This installs the skill for the agents you pick. Then run setup once from the installed skill folder
(`<skills folder>/showtime/bin/showtime setup`), and add the MCP server if you want it ([below](#mcp-only)).

### Other agents

Agents often run in a sandbox that blocks a large download, so run setup yourself once, in a normal terminal
(it prints the size first and resumes if interrupted):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/FavioVazquez/showtime ~/showtime
~/showtime/skills/showtime/bin/showtime setup      # Windows: ~\showtime\skills\showtime\bin\showtime.cmd setup
~/showtime/skills/showtime/bin/showtime doctor     # every line PASS (SKIP is fine)
```

Setup also writes the stable command `~/.showtime/bin/showtime` (Windows: `showtime.cmd`), which keeps working
when a plugin update moves the skill folder. In the commands below, `showtime` means that command.
`showtime install --agent <name>` links the skill where the agent looks, writes the ten crew agents in the
agent's own format and adds a `showtime` MCP server entry; it merges config files (one backup, never a
replacement), and `--print`, `--project` and `--uninstall` are there too.

<details>
<summary><b>OpenAI Codex</b> · tested</summary>

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add FavioVazquez/showtime
codex plugin add showtime@showtime
showtime install --agent codex --no-skill --no-mcp   # optional: the ten crew agents (~/.codex/agents)
```

Codex reads the root `plugin.json` and `mcp.json`; the skill appears as `showtime:showtime`. In its default
sandbox, allow network access and write access to `~/.showtime` (the exact `config.toml` lines are in
[docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md#openai-codex)). Headless: `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check "make a 5-second test video that says hello"`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b> · tested</summary>

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/FavioVazquez/showtime ~/.cursor/plugins/local/showtime   # then restart Cursor
agent --plugin-dir ~/.cursor/plugins/local/showtime                                             # the CLI
```

Cursor reads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: the skill, the crew and the MCP server all load. Without the
plugin: `showtime install --agent cursor`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Devin</b> · tested</summary>

```bash
devin plugins install FavioVazquez/showtime        # add --local to keep it off your Devin Cloud plugins
devin plugins info showtime                         # skill, 10 agents, MCP server "showtime"
```

Devin reads `.claude-plugin/`. The crew works in the CLI and Devin Desktop, not in Devin Cloud.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenCode</b> · tested</summary>

```bash
showtime install --agent opencode
```

The skill goes to `~/.agents/skills/showtime`, the crew to `~/.config/opencode/agents` and the MCP server to
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. Check with `opencode agent list` and `opencode mcp list`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>GitHub Copilot</b> (CLI and VS Code) · should work</summary>

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add FavioVazquez/showtime
copilot plugin install showtime@showtime
```

VS Code: run **Chat: Install Plugin From Source** with `https://github.com/FavioVazquez/showtime`. Without the
plugin: `showtime install --agent copilot`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Gemini CLI</b> · should work</summary>

```bash
showtime install --agent gemini
```

Adds the skill, the crew in Gemini's format and the MCP server. The repository is also a Gemini extension
(`gemini extensions install https://github.com/FavioVazquez/showtime`), which brings the skill and the MCP
server without the crew.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Antigravity</b> · should work</summary>

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/FavioVazquez/showtime ~/showtime
agy plugin install ~/showtime                     # skill, crew and MCP server
```

Or, without the plugin: `showtime install --agent antigravity`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cline, Kilo Code, Kiro, Zed, Goose, Amp, Qwen Code</b> · should work</summary>

```bash
showtime install --agent cline      # skill + MCP server (no crew: Cline's sub-agents cannot use MCP)
showtime install --agent kilo       # skill; add the MCP server in Kilo's settings with the command it prints
showtime install --agent kiro       # skill, crew and MCP server
showtime install --agent zed        # skill; it prints the context_servers entry to paste into settings.json
showtime install --agent goose      # skill; it prints the extension block for config.yaml
showtime install --agent amp        # or: amp mcp add showtime -- ~/.showtime/bin/showtime mcp
showtime install --agent qwen       # Qwen reads skills only from ~/.qwen/skills
```

In the Cline VS Code extension, add the MCP server under **MCP Servers > Configure MCP Servers** (the command
prints the entry), or let Cline follow [`llms-install.md`](llms-install.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Factory Droid</b> · should work</summary>

```bash
droid plugin marketplace add FavioVazquez/showtime
droid plugin install showtime@showtime
```

Factory translates the `.claude-plugin/` layout. Without the plugin: `showtime install --agent factory`.

</details>

<a id="mcp-only"></a>

### MCP only

Any client that starts local (stdio) servers can use showtime's MCP server on its own, without the skill. After
setup:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "showtime": { "command": "/home/<you>/.showtime/bin/showtime", "args": ["mcp"] }
  }
}
```

(Use the full path to that file in your home folder; on Windows it is `showtime.cmd` in `%USERPROFILE%\.showtime\bin`, written out in full.) Two more routes need no clone at all:

```json
{ "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@faviovazquez/showtime-mcp"] }
```

is the same server from npm ([@faviovazquez/showtime-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faviovazquez/showtime-mcp),
also listed in the [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=io.github.FavioVazquez/showtime)
as `io.github.FavioVazquez/showtime` and on [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/servers/favio-vazquezp/showtime)), and
[`showtime-0.3.0.mcpb`](https://github.com/FavioVazquez/showtime/releases/download/v0.3.0/showtime-0.3.0.mcpb) from
the v0.3.0 release opens in Claude Desktop with a double click. Setup still runs once on your machine: the
models and tools never travel inside a package. Long tools answer with a task id after about 20 seconds when a
client stops calls early; the `status` tool reports progress and the result. Besides the tools that mirror the commands,
`guide` reads a reference by the piece and `receipt` writes a job's receipt (tokens and cost are "not reported by this
agent" through MCP).

Two more kinds of developer video have a workflow but no example in this gallery yet: a **repo explainer** (what the
code does, a map of it, one request traced through real files and lines, every claim tied to a file and a commit) and
a **paper explainer** (claims tied to pages, figures shown only when their license allows, Manim for the math). Say
"explain this repo" or give your agent a paper's PDF or arXiv link. For release notes and pull requests with no agent at all,
`showtime release-video` and the [GitHub Action](docs/github-action.md) make a short film in CI.

## How it works

<p align="center"><picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/readme/diagrams/pipeline-dark.svg">
  <img alt="How showtime works. One sentence in your coding agent; your agent directs (assumptions, script, scenes, mix); a first look, and your notes loop back; the render runs on your machine (frames, voice, music, encode); showtime qa checks loudness, frames, captions and platform specs; out come an MP4 and an HTML video with poster, exports, captions and credits." src="assets/readme/diagrams/pipeline-light.svg" width="100%">
</picture></p>

Motion graphics are written as HTML, CSS and canvas and rendered frame-exactly in headless Chrome: every
frame is a pure function of time, so a render, its preview and its HTML video show the same picture.
Math scenes use Manim, and real footage is cut by transcript with ffmpeg.

### What runs where

<p align="center"><picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/readme/diagrams/runs-where-dark.svg">
  <img alt="What runs where. In your coding agent, your agent is the director: it reads your request and sources, states assumptions, writes the script, picks templates, scenes and sound, shows a first look, briefs the crew and checks the result. On your machine, in ~/.showtime, is the studio: headless Chrome, ffmpeg, Kokoro, Piper and Supertonic voices, local transcripts, a composer with 18 styles and 56 effect types, 1,334 sounds and 249 music tracks, Manim, and showtime qa. The web only when you ask: archive search and site capture fetch pages; nothing of yours is sent. No cloud AI service, no API keys, no uploads." src="assets/readme/diagrams/runs-where-light.svg" width="100%">
</picture></p>

showtime adds no cloud service of its own: no API keys, no accounts, nothing you make is uploaded.
Every model and tool is downloaded once into `~/.showtime`, the small ones at setup and the bigger ones the
first time a video needs them. After that it goes online only when you ask for something from the web: public-archive media search (Openverse, Wikimedia Commons, NASA) and website
capture fetch pages and files, and send nothing of yours.

### Quiet, checked and on the record

The 0.2.0 benchmark showed where an agent's budget goes with showtime: images kept in its context, long command
output and reference files read whole. 0.3.0 trims those without removing a check:

- **Check first, then one render.** `showtime check` (with the phone check and the look-repeat warning) runs before
  the full render, and a fix re-renders only the seconds that changed (`render --from S --to S`).
- **One picture per look.** `showtime look` makes a single 1280 px composite of the key frames plus a brief for a
  disposable reviewer that answers in text; your agent never has to open the image itself. About 12 images per job
  is the budget ([looking guide](skills/showtime/references/looking.md)).
- **Short output.** Without a terminal, `check`, `qa`, `doctor` and `render` print the verdict, the findings with
  their fixes and the paths; the full report is in a file. `--verbose` prints everything.
- **References by the piece.** Every guide opens with its rules, and `showtime guide <topic> [section]` prints just
  that part.
- **A receipt.** Each job ends with `receipt.md` and `receipt.json`: the request as typed, assumptions, review rounds,
  full and partial renders, images made for looking, wall time, and tokens and cost when your agent's session log is
  named. Anything unknown says "not reported by this agent"; nothing is estimated. Claude Code costs are labelled
  API-equivalent, since a plan does not pay per video ([format](skills/showtime/references/receipt.md)).

Every finished video gets the full review by default (quality mode: looks, qa and a critic round before delivery).
Say "lean" (or run `showtime config mode lean`) for a cheaper draft pass without the critic, and "show me options
first" for the full studio.

## Benchmark

A small benchmark: one-sentence video tasks, one run each, scored by automatic checks, an AI judge that must prove it
looked at every frame, and a blind vote by me. Round 4 compared showtime 0.3.0 **in lean mode** (the lighter review
setting, which was the default when the round ran) with 0.2.0 in its default mode, plain Claude Code on Opus 5.5 and,
for the launch video, an open-source tool built only for launch videos.

In my blind vote, 0.3.0 was preferred to 0.2.0 on 4 of 6 tasks and to plain Claude Code on 7 of 8, and its launch
video beat the launch-only tool for the first time in four rounds. The AI judge preferred 0.2.0's polish on most
tasks; that is why 0.3.0 ships with the full review (a critic round on every video) as the default, and that default
was not part of the round. I'm showtime's author, so treat these as anecdotes, not a result. Every number, limit and
loss is in the [benchmark report](https://faviovazquez.github.io/showtime/benchmark/), with each earlier version a
click away; the method and the code to rerun it are in [`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/).

## Meet the crew

Your agent is the director. For studio work and videos you will publish, it can hand parts of the job to
**ten specialist sub-agents** that ship with the plugin. They are optional: a quick video uses none of
them, except a researcher and a critic when you say it will be published (and scene builders for long
videos). Each member gets a written brief, works only in its own folder, never asks you anything, never
uploads, and reports back with a short status.

### Who hands what to whom

<p align="center"><picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/readme/diagrams/crew-handoff-dark.svg">
  <img alt="How the crew hands work around. The director, your agent in your session, writes a TASK.md brief for each member and merges each RESULT.md. I, pitch, in parallel: creative director (concepts and a wildcard), scriptwriter (facts, claims, hooks), brand designer (a brand kit); you pick a concept. II, plan: scriptwriter (the script), storyboard artist (storyboard and animatic), researcher (checks every claim), creative director (signs off); you sign off. III, build, in parallel: motion designers (one per scene), sound designer (bed, effects, mix), voice director (the voice-over). IV, review: the critic writes findings with frames; fixes go back to the same member. V, deliver: showtime qa, then the MP4 and HTML video. Footage jobs: editor, sound designer, researcher, critic. Members never talk to each other or to you." src="assets/readme/diagrams/crew-handoff-light.svg" width="100%">
</picture></p>

**Let your agent cast it** (the usual way). Studio mode brings in the company; for a quick video you will
publish, your agent adds the researcher and the critic on its own. Say **"no crew"** to keep everything in
one session.

```text
Let's make a launch trailer for this repo. Show me options first.
```

**Or call one member yourself**, by name (Claude Code syntax; in other agents, ask it to "spawn the researcher agent"):

```text
@agent-showtime:researcher check the claims in narration.md against the README
@agent-showtime:critic showtime-out/<job>/review/round-1/CRITIC.md
```

The agents live in [`agents/`](agents/); their briefs, in
[`skills/showtime/references/crew/`](skills/showtime/references/crew/), work on any agent host, and the
[crew guide](skills/showtime/references/crew.md) has the dispatch rules.

For a video you will publish, a fix is judged by preference, not by a score. After a fix, `showtime review-pack --against best`
sets the new render beside the best one so far as a blind pair, and two fresh critics judge it, one in each order.
`showtime review-verdict` applies the rule: the new render wins only when it is preferred both times; a tie or a split
keeps the older one. There are up to three rounds, then the best version ships with its open findings listed
([review guide](skills/showtime/references/review.md)).

## Studio mode

Quick mode is the default: one request in, a video out. Studio is opt-in ("show me options first").

  R["Your request"] --> Q{"Options first?"}
  Q -->|"no, the default"| QM["Quick mode"]
  Q -->|"yes, studio"| SM["Studio mode"]
  QM --> P{"Will you publish it?"}
  P -->|"yes"| RC["Researcher and critic join"]
  P -->|"no"| D["Checked by showtime qa"]

```

Quick mode is one sentence in and a video out; studio mode opens a local board first, then builds.

In studio you talk about facts and goals in chat; everything about look, sound and timing is shown on a
board, a local page served on `127.0.0.1` with a token, with lettered options, one recommendation and
buttons you click.

<details>
<summary><b>The audio toolkit</b></summary>

Everything is local and license-gated: no sample leaves your machine, and an asset that needs
attribution writes itself into `credits.txt`. Catalog tracks are downloaded from their creators on first use
(with the size announced) and never re-hosted here.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `audio compose` | procedural music to an exact length in 18 styles, with stems, MIDI and a beat map; restrained beds for explainers and data, livelier styles on request |
| `audio sfx` | 56 synthesized effect types (whooshes, hits, UI clicks, risers), with the hit time printed |
| `audio music` | the produced-music catalog: 297 tracks, each measured for quality and tagged by mood, energy and tempo; `audio music pick --for launch --dur 45` chooses one, and the credit lands in `credits.txt` and the post copy by itself |
| `audio lib` | the local library, 1,334 sounds: CC0 effects and ambiences, CC-BY music beds credited automatically, and beds rendered on your machine; `audio packs` adds 35 more sound packs (34 CC0, 1 CC BY) on demand |
| `audio beats` | beats, downbeats, onsets, energy, sections and key, so cuts land on the music |
| `audio fit` | loops or trims music to a length on bar lines |
| `audio mix` | one mix file: ducking under the voice, effects aligned to hits, loudness |
| `audio meter`, `audio master` | LUFS, true peak and loudness range; mastering to -14 LUFS / -1 dBTP by default |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Math with Manim</b></summary>

`showtime manim new|render|check|cues` makes equations, proofs, graphs and grid transforms with Manim
Community (the `manim` extra; LaTeX is needed only for equations), and times them to the narration.
[Example 22](https://github.com/FavioVazquez/showtime-examples/tree/main/examples/22-manim-circle-area) cuts a circle into rings, unrolls them into a triangle and
lands on

$$A = \tfrac{1}{2} \cdot 2\pi r \cdot r = \pi r^2$$

with a vertical cut for Shorts from the same scenes. An optional OpenGL engine (the `manimgl` extra) runs
scene files written for it. `showtime manim check` also renders a draft and runs qa's black-frame and frozen-frame
detectors on it, so a near-black scene or a barely visible change is reported before the full render.

## New in 0.3.0

**Quieter runs, full review by default**

- **Lean mode, when you ask for it.** The full review stays the default; say "lean" (or run
  `showtime config mode lean`) for a lighter pass without the critic round. In both modes `showtime look` makes one
  composite image that a disposable reviewer reads (your agent does not), `render` says when a project was not
  checked first and names the cheaper `--from/--to` fix after a second full render, and `check`, `qa`, `doctor` and
  `render` print a short summary by default (`--verbose` for everything). Every reference opens with its rules
  (`showtime guide <topic>` prints them). No check was removed. In benchmark round 4, lean runs read a median of 4.5
  images into the agent's context and made a median of one full render per job.
- **`showtime job init` checks your setup** and prints `setup: ready` or the failures with their fixes, so it is the
  one command to start with.

**Better videos**

- **Variety guard.** Each finished job's look (template, theme, palette, type pair, transitions, camera moves, music,
  structure, tone) goes into a local history that never leaves your machine (`showtime history off` turns it off).
  `showtime check` warns `look_repeat` when a project repeats one of the last five, with two concrete alternatives.
- **Style references.** `showtime reference <video>` writes a brief with the video's cut rhythm, shot lengths, how
  scenes change, palette, camera moves, rough type scale and loudness curve, and a contact sheet. The storyboard
  borrows the grammar, never the words, logos or shots; the credit "Style reference: ..." is written for you, and
  `showtime qa` fails a render that copies the reference's pictures ([guide](skills/showtime/references/reference.md)).
- **Phone check.** `showtime check` ends with `phone check: PASS` or `FAIL` with timestamps: each text held long
  enough to read (per language), a minimum type size at phone width (16:9 5 pt, 1:1 10, 4:5 11, 9:16 15) and nothing
  under a platform's buttons or at the edge. In `qa`, a failure is a warning, never a FAIL.
- **Brand first for launches.** `showtime brand capture <repo|url> --job <job>` takes the product's palette with
  roles, fonts, logo, wordmark, real copy (with file and line) and real UI before the storyboard, and `showtime new
  launch` applies it. A launch job with no kit says why (`showtime brand skip`), and `check` warns when it does not.
- **Pairwise review.** See [the crew](#meet-the-crew): a new version ships only if the critic prefers it in both orders.
- **Fixes where agents tripped:** a clip's frames no longer depend on the order the frames were asked for,
  `retime --from-voice --total` works when every scene is narrated, Manim silent films and `--mix` paths work, `doctor`
  warns when the `showtime` command on your path is not the agent's, and font errors name the exact missing
  characters and the fix.

**New kinds of video**

- **Repo explainers and paper explainers** (workflows `repo-explainer` and `paper-explainer`), described
  [above](#for-developers).
- **`showtime release-video`** turns release notes, a CHANGELOG section or a PR description into a ready-to-render
  project with no agent: the notes' own words, reading-time holds, the people credited.
- **A GitHub Action** that renders a release or PR video on the runner, checks it, exports an HTML video and a copy
  under 10 MB, and uploads them ([guide](docs/github-action.md)). It needs no API key unless you choose the mode that
  runs your own agent.
- **`showtime adopt <folder | page | script>`** takes a video someone already wrote as a function of time (an HTML
  page with `seek(t)`, a canvas `draw(t)`, a CSS-animated page, a Python frame function) and gives it showtime's checks,
  sound, captions, qa, HTML export and review, without a rewrite. The originals are never changed
  ([guide](skills/showtime/references/adopt.md)).

**Honesty**

- **Receipts.** Every job ends with `receipt.md`, `receipt.json` and a line in `share.txt` (see
  [above](#quiet-checked-and-on-the-record)).

**In progress** (landing before the release):

- A fix to a few seconds (`render --from A --to B --job <job>`) splices into a complete new final: only those frames change, the audio is mastered again, and a span is never mistaken for the video.
- Every Manim template passes its own check, and a scene's first element is on screen at frame 0.

Limits: the phone check and the look history read the project files and cannot judge whether a video is good; a
model reviewer's preference is steadier than its score but is still an opinion; tokens and cost appear only for
agents that expose their session log (Claude Code and Codex, as numbers only), and everything else says "not reported
by this agent". The full list is in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## New in 0.2.0

- **Works in your coding agent.** One repository for every agent: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Devin and OpenCode
  are tested, and Copilot, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cline, Kilo Code, Kiro, Zed, Goose, Amp, Factory Droid and
  Qwen Code are packaged ([Works with](#works-with)). `showtime install --agent <name>` puts the skill, the crew
  and the MCP server where an agent looks. A stable `~/.showtime/bin/showtime` command survives plugin updates,
  long commands can run in the background (`--background`, `showtime status`), and `showtime doctor` knows the
  sandboxes of the common agents and says which setting to change.
- **A lighter first run.** The default download is about 770 MB on Linux x64 (about 560 to 610 MB on macOS and
  Windows) instead of 2.9 GB. `showtime setup --plan` lists every component with its size and when it is
  fetched, and `showtime setup --full` installs everything up front. Nothing was removed: a piece that left the
  default install (the transcription model, Manim, the audio library beyond its 41 MB starter, browser and icon
  extras) is fetched the first time a video needs it, announced with its size. Homes made by 0.1 keep working;
  `setup --prune` clears what is no longer used.
- **A real music catalog.** 297 produced tracks (Scott Buckley, Kevin MacLeod, a dozen more composers and
  public-domain recordings),
  each downloaded and measured for hiss, clipping, mono, dead gaps and loudness swings, tagged by mood, energy,
  tempo and use, and picked with `showtime audio music pick`. Tracks are fetched from their creators on first use
  and never re-hosted. Every render that uses one writes the credit into `credits.txt` and the post copy by
  itself, and prints a note. 35 more sound packs (34 CC0) install when a search needs them.
- **Platforms.** Apple Silicon and Linux arm64 now run end to end in CI, Windows 11 on Arm runs with an x64
  Python under Windows' emulation ([Requirements](#requirements)), and `scripts/e2e.py` repeats the whole
  path on any machine.
- **A safer preview server.** `showtime preview` and `showtime server` answer only requests that carry a
  random per-session key from the printed link; before, any web page open in your browser could read a
  project's files over `127.0.0.1`.
- **Footage edits that hear the ums.** The default transcription is now Parakeet-TDT 0.6B v3 (25 languages
  including English and Spanish; fetched on first use, 465 MB; Whisper stays for other languages and with
  `--model`). It keeps "um" and "uh" as words, and a scan after it hears the hesitations no word covers. On a public,
  human-labelled podcast set (20 episodes, 495 labelled fillers) it found 81% of them at 83% precision against the
  labels, where 0.1.0's default found 11% at 78%; on the benchmark interview it cuts all five known "uh" (the
  benchmark's scorer credits 4 of 5; 0.1.0's default commands cut none). Cuts get 20 ms crossfades. Speech under
  music is heard better because showtime transcribes its own dry narration stem, and separates the voice only when
  the music is loud: word errors at equal loudness fell from 19.7% to 7.3% on a small test set. These are local
  evaluations on a few sets, not a guarantee for your footage; label-based precision understates it, since the
  labels miss some real fillers. CrisperWhisper is available as an opt-in model under its non-commercial licence
  (not on Intel Macs).
- **Launch videos by default.** Ask for a launch, promo or release video and the default is a calm short film of
  four to six scenes: a big still hook, one smooth fly-through into the product, the same window carried across the
  cuts, and a produced track whose swell lands on the end card. The camera only moves when it has a reason; the
  motion comes from the product itself. Terminals and code shrink to fit every size, and `showtime check` stops a
  render when text would be cut off.

The full list is in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Requirements

showtime is built for macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), Windows 10/11 and Linux (x86_64 and arm64). What has
actually been run, and where ("end to end" means setup, doctor, a voiced render with qa, HTML export,
transcription, captions and the MCP server):

- **Intel Mac** (a physical machine): end to end, plus the fast test suite.
- **Apple Silicon**: end to end on GitHub's `macos-14` (M1) runners, plus the fast suite. A run on a physical
  Apple Silicon Mac is still welcome.
- **Linux x86_64**: end to end on Ubuntu 24.04 (AWS), plus the fast suite.
- **Linux arm64**: end to end on GitHub's `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runners.
- **Windows Server 2025 x64**: end to end as a standard user (AWS) and on GitHub's `windows-2025` runners.
- **Windows 11 on Arm**: end to end on GitHub's `windows-11-arm` runners, plus the fast suite. showtime's
  Python and ffmpeg run as x64 under Windows' emulation there (some packages have no Windows arm64 build, and the
  native arm64 ffmpeg build did not start on the runner), so it is slower than on x64.
- **Windows 10/11 x64 desktop as a standard user**: not yet run on a real machine. If you have one,
  `scripts/e2e-windows.ps1` runs everything and zips the result to attach to an
  [issue](https://github.com/FavioVazquez/showtime/issues).

CI runs the fast test suite on Linux, Windows and Apple Silicon for every change, and on an Intel Mac
nightly. Expect rough edges on anything marked not yet run, and please open an issue when something breaks.

| | macOS 14+ | Windows 10/11 (x64) | Linux (glibc 2.28+: Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Status | Intel: tested<br>Apple Silicon: tested (CI, end to end) | Server 2025 x64: tested<br>11 on Arm: run in CI, rerun pending<br>10/11 x64 desktop: not yet run | x86_64: tested<br>arm64: tested (CI, end to end) |

| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 24 or 22 LTS (20+) | installer | installer or winget | fnm or NodeSource |

Chrome, Edge or Chromium is found automatically; if none is installed, setup downloads Chrome's headless
shell (about 100 MB). Disk: the default install is about 770 MB on Linux x64 (700 MB on Linux arm64) and 560 to 610 MB on
macOS and Windows, with a browser already installed and about 100 MB more without one, instead of 2.9 GB in 0.1; `showtime setup --plan` prints yours,
component by component. What a video needs only sometimes arrives the first time it is used, with its size
announced: the transcription model (Parakeet, 465 MB, once),
Manim (60 MB), the audio library's starter part (41 MB), a music track or a sound pack (each a few MB to a few
dozen). `showtime setup --full` fetches all of it now, for a machine that will be offline (about 5.1 to 5.7 GB,
mostly the 1.6 GB Whisper large-v3-turbo model and 0.9 GB of the music catalog; Scott Buckley asks for no bulk
downloads, so his tracks still download one at a time, the first time a video uses them).

<details>
<summary><b>Install commands for uv and Node.js</b></summary>

macOS and Linux:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Node.js: the installer from nodejs.org (macOS), or on Linux fnm (distribution packages are often older than 20):
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash && fnm install 22
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e      # or: powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS --source winget   # or the installer from nodejs.org
```

On Linux, if the browser does not start, install Chromium's system libraries once (after setup):
`sudo "$(command -v node)" ~/.showtime/node/node_modules/playwright/cli.js install-deps chromium`.
[NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) packages work too.

</details>

ffmpeg is downloaded as a static build, so a system ffmpeg is not needed. Installing uv or Node.js
updates `PATH` for new terminals only: **restart your coding agent afterwards** (showtime also looks in the
installers' default folders if the new `PATH` has not reached it yet).

<details>
<summary><b>Setup from a terminal, and what it installs</b></summary>

The first time showtime is used, your agent tells you the size and time and runs the setup once you agree. The first time a video
needs a bigger piece (library sounds, a music track, the transcription model, Manim), showtime fetches just that piece and prints its
size first; `showtime setup --full` fetches everything up front. To run setup yourself, use a clone (both share `~/.showtime`).

macOS and Linux (bash, zsh):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FavioVazquez/showtime
showtime/skills/showtime/bin/showtime setup
showtime/skills/showtime/bin/showtime doctor
showtime/skills/showtime/bin/showtime setup --plan     # what setup and first use download, with sizes
showtime/skills/showtime/bin/showtime audio lib fetch  # optional: the whole sound library now (about 249 MB)
```

Windows PowerShell (`showtime.cmd` also works from cmd; `showtime.ps1` is there too):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/FavioVazquez/showtime
& .\showtime\skills\showtime\bin\showtime.cmd setup
& .\showtime\skills\showtime\bin\showtime.cmd doctor
& .\showtime\skills\showtime\bin\showtime.cmd setup --plan
& .\showtime\skills\showtime\bin\showtime.cmd audio lib fetch   # optional: the whole sound library now
```

Setup also writes `~/.showtime/bin/showtime` (Windows: `showtime.cmd`), a command that keeps working when a
plugin update moves the skill folder, and prints how to put it on your `PATH` (it never changes `PATH` itself).
Without it, `skills/showtime/bin/showtime` is the entry point (the skill's folder, not the plugin's top folder). On
Windows that runs `showtime.cmd` (from cmd or PowerShell); call `showtime.ps1` directly only where the PowerShell
execution policy allows scripts.

| In `~/.showtime` (move it with `SHOWTIME_HOME`) | Contents |
|---|---|
| `bin/` | static `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` for your OS and CPU |
| `venv/` | Python 3.12 environment with pinned packages |
| `node/` | pinned Node packages: Playwright, animation, charts, math, icons, fonts |
| `browsers/` | Chrome's headless shell, only when no Chrome/Edge/Chromium is installed |
| `models/` | the Kokoro voice, face detection and denoise models at setup; transcription models on the first transcription |
| `soundfonts/` | the FluidR3Mono General MIDI bank (MIT) and its license |
| `library/` | the audio library, fetched in parts: CC0 effects and ambiences, CC-BY music beds (credited automatically), plus effects and beds rendered locally; `showtime audio lib fetch --tier extended` adds about 200 MB more music |
| `music/` | produced-music catalog tracks, each fetched from its creator the first time a mix uses it |

Downloads resume after an interruption and are skipped when already present, so re-running setup is
always safe. Setup's downloads, the optional extras, the core audio library, the music catalog, the sound
packs and the models fetched on first use (the English aligner, Piper voices) are pinned by URL, size and
SHA-256. Two are not pinned
yet: the extended audio-library tier records each file's SHA-256 on its first download and verifies
every re-download against it (trust on first use), and the background-removal engine used outside
macOS (rembg, a pinned package version) fetches its model with its own downloader. Features that need
an optional extra say so and print the exact command; nothing is installed behind your back.

```bash
showtime setup --list                     # tiers, extras and their sizes
showtime setup --plan                     # every component: size, source, when it is fetched (--platform X for another OS)
showtime setup --estimate                 # what this run would download, and how long it takes
showtime setup --full                     # everything now, nothing fetched later (offline machines; --seed DIR reuses files)
showtime setup --prune                    # remove files from older versions that nothing uses any more
showtime setup --with asr-turbo,diarize   # add extras (keeps what is already installed)
showtime setup --tier full                # core + the common extras
```

| Extra | What it adds |
|---|---|
| `asr-turbo` | Whisper large-v3-turbo, transcripts for languages outside Parakeet's 25 |
| `parakeet-v3` | Parakeet-TDT 0.6B v3, the default verbatim transcription (25 languages, keeps fillers); fetched on first use anyway |
| `parakeet` | Parakeet-TDT 0.6B v2, English only; fetched on first use when asked for |
| `separate` | UVR MDX-Net vocal separator for speech under loud music; fetched when a transcription needs it |
| `diarize` | speaker labels for interviews and podcasts |
| `events` | audio event tags (laughter, applause, music) |
| `supertonic` | Supertonic 3 voices (Spanish and 30 more languages) |
| `sf-generaluser` | the GeneralUser GS SoundFont, a richer General MIDI bank (its own free license) |
| `sf-musescore` | the MuseScore General orchestral SoundFont |

<summary><b>What showtime runs and downloads</b>: every download, and what goes over the network</summary>

**What runs.** Installing the plugin downloads this repository and nothing else. It adds the `showtime`
skill (Claude runs `skills/showtime/bin/showtime`, a Python and Node command line, in your terminal), a
local MCP server (`node skills/showtime/mcp/server.mjs` over stdio; it makes no network calls of its own), a
progress monitor while the skill is in use (`node skills/showtime/mcp/progress-monitor.mjs`, which reads
`~/.showtime/logs/progress.jsonl`), and ten optional sub-agents. No hooks. Setup runs only after Claude has
told you the size and time and you agree, or when you run it yourself. Files go to `~/.showtime` (or
`SHOWTIME_HOME`, or the plugin's `home` setting) and each video to `showtime-out/<slug>-<timestamp>/` in
your project.

**Setup downloads** (the default `core` tier, about 2.9 GB). Every model and ffmpeg file is checked against
a size and SHA-256 pinned in `skills/showtime/setup/manifest.json`:

| What | From | Size |
|---|---|---|
| ffmpeg 9.0.2 and ffprobe, static builds (GPL), skipped when a capable ffmpeg is already installed | macOS Intel: evermeet.cx (fallback ffmpeg.martin-riedl.de); Apple Silicon: ffmpeg.martin-riedl.de; Windows: gyan.dev builds from github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg (fallback github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds); Linux: github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds (x64 fallback ffmpeg.martin-riedl.de) | 52 to 194 MB, one build |
| Python packages, in a Python 3.12 environment (uv downloads Python 3.12 if you do not have it) | PyPI through uv; versions pinned in `setup/requirements.txt` | about 1.5 GB installed |
| Node packages: Playwright, anime.js, D3, three.js, KaTeX, Shiki, Lottie, icon sets and 16 Fontsource font packages | registry.npmjs.org, `npm ci` from `setup/package-lock.json` (integrity hashes, no install scripts) | about 250 MB installed |
| Kokoro 82M text-to-speech, two model files and the voices (Apache-2.0) | huggingface.co/onnx-community, github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx | 679 MB |
| Whisper small.en transcription (MIT) | huggingface.co/Systran | 486 MB |
| Silero VAD (MIT), the YuNet face detector (MIT), arnndn denoise models, the FluidR3Mono SoundFont (MIT) | github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx, github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo, raw.githubusercontent.com (richardpl/arnndn-models, musescore/MuseScore), pinned to a release or commit | 27 MB |
| Chromium, only when no Chrome, Edge or Chromium is installed (or with `--with chromium`) | Playwright's download server, through `playwright install` | not in the 2.9 GB |

On macOS, setup removes the download quarantine flag from the ffmpeg binaries (`xattr -d
com.apple.quarantine`) so Gatekeeper does not block them.

**Downloaded later, only when a feature needs it.** The command or Claude says so first.

- The audio library, `showtime audio lib fetch`: the core set is 87 files (about 250 MB, CC0 and CC BY 4.0)
  from kenney.nl, opengameart.org, incompetech.com and archive.org, pinned by SHA-256. `--tier extended`
  adds 218 files (about 1 GB) from incompetech.com, archive.org and opengameart.org; those are not pinned
  yet, so each file's SHA-256 is recorded at its first download and checked on every re-download.
- The English word aligner, wav2vec2 (95 MB, Hugging Face, pinned), the first time narration is aligned;
  a Piper voice (67 to 116 MB, github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx releases, pinned) when you choose one.
- Another Whisper model (Hugging Face, 150 MB to 3 GB, not pinned) when you transcribe with `--model`, or
  speech that is not English (`small`, about 480 MB).
- Outside macOS, background removal installs the rembg package from PyPI, and rembg downloads its own
  model (about 170 MB) the first time.
- Optional extras, only with `showtime setup --with <name>` (the list and sizes: `showtime setup --list`):
  larger Whisper and Parakeet transcription, speaker labels, audio event tags, Supertonic voices,
  DeepFilterNet, RIFE, two more SoundFonts and Manim/ManimGL (from Hugging Face, GitHub releases, OSU OSL
  and PyPI, pinned by SHA-256 except the Python packages), and MusicGen (PyPI, PyTorch's package index on
  Linux, and Meta's non-commercial weights from Hugging Face).

`SHOWTIME_OFFLINE=1` stops the web asset lookups and the voice-model downloads.

**What goes over the network.** showtime adds no cloud service: no accounts, no telemetry (Hugging Face's
is switched off too) and no uploads. Every request it makes is a download. Rendering is offline: the
headless browser that draws the frames blocks every request that is not local, and an HTML video carries a
content security policy that allows no network access. The web is used only when you ask for something
from it:

- web assets: fonts (api.fontsource.org, cdn.jsdelivr.net), icons and emoji (cdn.jsdelivr.net,
  raw.githubusercontent.com), and openly licensed photos and video (Openverse, Wikimedia Commons, NASA,
  the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Met, the Art Institute of Chicago, or a URL you give);
- a web page you name, loaded in a local browser to capture it (`showtime site capture <url>`, `showtime
  demo record --url`, `showtime brand init --url`), with cookie banners declined and trackers blocked;
- the optional researcher sub-agent, which checks facts with Claude Code's web tools.

Those requests carry the search words or the URL and a `showtime/<version>` user agent; your files and
videos are never sent. The studio board and the preview server listen on 127.0.0.1 only, and the board's
link carries a random key.

<summary><b>Troubleshooting</b></summary>

| Symptom | Try |
|---|---|
| Anything looks wrong with the install | `showtime doctor`: real checks with a one-line fix for each problem (`--json` for scripts) |
| A command says setup has not been run | `showtime setup`; it prints the size and time first |
| A feature asks for an extra | run the `showtime setup --with <name>` it prints (or set `SHOWTIME_AUTO_INSTALL=1`) |
| An error needs more detail | re-run with `--debug` for the full traceback; the last one is also saved in `~/.showtime/logs/last-error.log` |
| You want to report a bug | `showtime doctor --report <job folder>` writes a redacted `bug-report.md` there; read it, then share it if you like. showtime never uploads anything |
| Linux: the browser does not start | install Chromium's system libraries once: `sudo "$(command -v node)" ~/.showtime/node/node_modules/playwright/cli.js install-deps chromium` |
| `uv`/`node` not found right after installing them | restart your coding agent (or open a new terminal) so it sees the new `PATH` |
| Your agent's sandbox blocks the download or `~/.showtime` | `showtime doctor` names the setting to change for that agent; or run `showtime setup` yourself once in a normal terminal; or `SHOWTIME_HOME=.showtime showtime setup` to install inside the project |
| Your agent looks for `bin/showtime` and cannot find it | the entry point is `~/.showtime/bin/showtime` (written by setup) or `<skill folder>/bin/showtime`; the plugin's top folder has no `bin/` |
| `showtime doctor` takes minutes right after a restart | normal on the first run: the OS (macOS especially) checks the native libraries as they load for the first time. doctor says so and shows what it is checking; later runs take seconds |
| Claude Code says the showtime MCP server timed out | usually the first start after a reboot, while the OS checks the Node.js binary; run `/mcp` and reconnect, or start Claude Code with `MCP_TIMEOUT=60000`. The `showtime` skill works without it |
| Setup was interrupted | run it again; downloads resume and finished items are skipped |
| Files look corrupt | `showtime setup --verify` re-hashes everything; `--force` reinstalls |
| You want your own binaries | set `SHOWTIME_FFMPEG`, `SHOWTIME_CHROME`, `SHOWTIME_NODE` or `SHOWTIME_PYTHON` |
| Output colours or progress bars clutter logs | `NO_COLOR=1`; progress is plain lines automatically when not in a terminal |

Platform notes (by design; see the status above): Apple Silicon runs everything natively and renders
WebGL through Metal; Intel Macs get the last x86_64 builds of ONNX Runtime and numba automatically; on
Windows, drive letters, spaces and parentheses in paths are handled everywhere, including inside ffmpeg
filters; Linux machines without a GPU render WebGL through SwiftShader. Hardware encoders and macOS-only
features are used only when present, with portable fallbacks.

<summary><b>Use showtime from other tools (MCP)</b></summary>

showtime ships an MCP server (`skills/showtime/mcp/server.mjs`, Node only, no extra install) with a
small set of coarse tools: `doctor`, `new_project`, `render`, `check`, `snap`, `qa`, `voice_say`,
`voice_script`, `transcribe`, `audio_compose`, `audio_sfx`, `audio_mix`, `audio_search`, `export_html`,
`studio_open`, `studio_feedback`, `deliver_exports`, `receipt` and `status`. Each runs the matching `showtime`
command on your machine and answers with a short summary and the paths it wrote; a tool that runs longer than about
20 seconds answers with a task id, and `status` reports progress and the result. The plugins register it for you.
For Claude Desktop or any other MCP client, run `~/.showtime/bin/showtime mcp` (see [MCP only](#mcp-only) for the
snippet and the npm and `.mcpb` routes); the snippet for each client is in
[references/mcp.md](skills/showtime/references/mcp.md), next to the plugin settings (default voice and
language, a CPU limit) and the render progress monitor.

## Docs

<p align="center"><picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/readme/diagrams/docs-map-dark.svg">
  <img alt="The documentation map: fourteen workflows (launch video, explainer, tutorial, social short, data story, footage edit, trailer, slideshow, changelog video, music video, voice-over only, localize, repo explainer, paper explainer), then five acts and a finale of guides, from onboarding to qa and review." src="assets/readme/diagrams/docs-map-light.svg" width="100%">
</picture></p>

The [documentation map](docs/README.md) is the way in: every guide, grouped by what you are making, from
workflows (launch, explainer, tutorial, social, data, footage, trailer) to story and craft, sound and
voice, rendering, and QA. The glossary is in [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md), and what showtime deliberately
does not do, and why, is in [.out-of-scope/](.out-of-scope/README.md).

Installing in a particular agent: [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md) has the exact steps for each, and what each
test covered. The same guides are also a searchable site, with the gallery playing every example:
**[faviovazquez.github.io/showtime](https://faviovazquez.github.io/showtime/)**.

## License and credits

showtime's own code is MIT licensed ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). Setup downloads third-party tools and models
under their own licenses, recorded per item in `skills/showtime/setup/manifest.json`. Notable ones: the
static ffmpeg builds are GPL; Kokoro is Apache-2.0; Whisper models are MIT; Parakeet (NVIDIA) and TitaNet
are CC-BY-4.0; the vocal separator UVR-MDX-NET-Voc_FT is MIT, by the Ultimate Vocal Remover project (UVR)
and its developers; CrisperWhisper 2.0 weights (opt-in only, `--model crisper`) are non-commercial and
ask for your acceptance first; Supertonic weights are OpenRAIL-M; FluidR3Mono and MuseScore General are MIT; GeneralUser GS
(optional) has its own free license; MusicGen weights (optional) are CC-BY-NC-4.0, non-commercial. The
brand (Curtain Call) is described in [assets/brand/](assets/brand/BRAND.md). The produced-music catalog is
by Scott Buckley and Kevin MacLeod (CC BY 4.0) plus CC0 and public-domain recordings; the tracks stay on their
creators' sites, are fetched on first use, and every render that uses one writes its credit into `credits.txt`
and the post copy (a track that needs a credit and has none stops the mix). Each example credits its
sources in its own folder, and example 13 is CC BY-SA 4.0, like the article it adapts. The videos you
make are yours; when a render uses an asset that needs attribution, showtime writes `credits.txt` next
to it.
