"""showtime: local video making, directed by your coding agent.

The `st` package holds the Python side of the skill. Modules that the
launcher, installer and doctor import (st.platform, st.common, st.ff,
st.doctor) are stdlib-only and Python 3.8+ compatible; everything else runs
inside the showtime virtualenv (~/.showtime/venv, Python 3.12).
