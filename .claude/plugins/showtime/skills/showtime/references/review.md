# Review: the critic pass and acting on feedback

Read this when a video is finished (quality mode, the default, reviews every finished video), when it is
headed for publishing, when the user asks for a critique, or when the user (or a critic) sends notes on a
draft, storyboard or animatic.
The checklists live in `qa.md`; this file is the review protocol (self-review, critic, notes).

## Essentials

- Quality mode (the default): every finished video gets a critic round by a fresh sub-agent before delivery;
  `showtime qa <job>` says "review pending" with the command until the round has a verdict. The first round is
  pairwise (`--against <previous final>`) when the job has an earlier final (§1)
- Lean mode (only when the user asked for a draft): self-review (`qa`, `look`, the must-show list, the eight
  questions); the critic only when publish-bound, studio, or asked (§1)
- Type detail pass: every text frame at full size (`frames/text-*.png`), never only on contact sheets (§1)
- Build the pack with `showtime review-pack <job>` (`--platform`, `--lufs -16` for another target); pack every
  deliverable you publish (`--project <dir>` for a file outside the job) (§2)
- Give the critic only the path of `CRITIC.md`, ask for `FINDINGS.md` there (save a chat answer there yourself);
  name a vision-capable model; never tell it what to ignore or how severe things are (§2, §3)
- Round 2 on is pairwise (`showtime review-pack <job> --against best`): two fresh critics at once, one per
  `order-N/CRITIC.md` (§2, §3)
- No sub-agent tool: answer `CRITIC.md` yourself into `FINDINGS.md`, starting `SELF-REVIEW (no critic
  available)`, and tell the user it was a self-review (§3)
- Confirm each finding with `showtime snap <project> --at t` before changing anything; blockers first, then
  should-fix; keep a finding you disagree with and say why, never drop it silently (§4)
- Then re-render, `showtime check` after timing fixes, `showtime qa <job>`, a pairwise round, and
  `showtime review-verdict <job>`: an improvement only when preferred in both orders (§4)
- Three rounds at most; then ship the best version with its open findings listed (§4)
- The critic's absolute line, `WOULD I POST THIS: yes | no`, is judged alone; in quality mode a "no" holds
  delivery even when the pairwise preferred the render, and a caption should-fix needs a later `fixed` or your
  `won't fix: <reason>` in `review/round-N/RESPONSE.md` (§4)
- User notes: echo them back numbered with timestamps; ask only about an ambiguous one (2-3 readings, a
  default); apply blockers, then cheap tweaks, then structural changes (§5)
- Prove fixes with `showtime snap <new> --at t --compare <old>`; push back when a note collides with a locked
  decision; log every round in `work/feedback.md` and `showtime job note --stage feedback --verified "..."` (§5)

## 1. Pick the tier

- **Quality mode (the default), every finished video**: first the self-review below (`showtime qa <job>` on
  the latest final, `showtime look <job>`, the must-show list, the questions), then one critic round by a
  fresh sub-agent before delivery (optionally also one on the first look in studio). `showtime qa`,
  `status`, `deliver exports` and `job note --stage deliver` print `WARN review pending ... -> <command>`
  until the round has a verdict: FINDINGS.md with its VERDICT line, or a pairwise round decided by
  `showtime review-verdict`. When the job already has an earlier final (a fix after a look), the command it
  names is pairwise, `showtime review-pack <job> --against <that final>`, so the round also says whether the
  fix helped. A "not ready" verdict keeps the review pending until a later round (section 4). When the video
  states facts, numbers or claims, the `showtime:researcher` checks every claim and asset license before
  the final render (`crew/researcher.md`).
- **Lean mode** (the user asked for a quick draft, a rough cut, something cheap, or no review;
  `modes.md` section 6): the self-review only. The critic runs when the work is publish-bound or studio, or
  the user asks.

The critic sees files, never the conversation. This is the only critic protocol; `qa.md` defers to it.

Self-review questions (also what a critic weighs):
1. Hook: at 1.5 s, does a stranger know what this is about and want to keep watching?
2. Clarity: after the whole video, could they say what it is, who it's for and how to get it?
3. Readability: is any text too small, too short-lived, low-contrast or in a platform UI zone?
4. Craft: alignment, spacing, consistent type and colour, clean transitions (check mid-cut frames), no
   muddy double exposures, no effects the tone does not justify. Then the **type detail pass**: look at
   every title and text frame at full size (the pack's `frames/text-*.png` crops and the full frames in
   `frames/`, never only the contact sheets, which shrink these flaws away) and check each line: words,
   math and numbers on one line share one baseline (a formula, a superscript or a number sitting lower
   or higher than the words beside it reads broken); they look one size (matching x-heights) and one
   weight (thin math beside bold words); kerning and word spacing are even; no widow (one word alone on
   the last line) or orphaned punctuation. Any of these in a title, the hook or the poster is a
   Should-fix. Manim scenes: `showtime manim check` flags mixed lines (`baseline_mismatch`,
   `xheight_mismatch`, `mixed_type`); build them with `mixed_line()` (`references/manim.md`).
5. Distinctness: could these frames belong to a different product unchanged?
6. Poster: which single frame would you post as the thumbnail? Is frame 0 that frame?
7. Honesty: does anything look like an invented claim, number, testimonial or fake UI presented as real?
8. Story logic: for every shot, what does a stranger think it is, and why is it here? A shot that is
   pretty but unexplained (a random landscape after a reveal, footage unrelated to the claim beside
   it, a visual that only makes sense to the author) is a Should-fix; one at the hook or the payoff is
   a Blocker. Walk the scene list in order and name the job of each shot (show the product, prove a
   claim, set up the next beat); a shot with no job gets cut or replaced.

Launch, promo, release and trailer films add the premium grammar's checklist
(`workflows/launch-video.md`, "Checklist"): 4-6 scenes, continuous scene changes, settled holds, one type
system and accent, no punch-ins or bounce, a produced track whose phrases carry the cuts and whose swell
carries the name. `review-pack` writes it into `CRITIC.md` with qa's measured rhythm line.

## 2. Build the pack

```
showtime review-pack <job>          # the job's latest final; or a video file; add --platform reels etc.
showtime review-pack <job> --lufs -16   # a loudness target other than the platform's (tutorials, podcasts)
```

The pack's fresh qa run judges like your last `showtime qa` of the same file: its `--platform` and `--lufs`
carry over unless you pass new ones, so CRITIC.md never reports a -16 LUFS mix as "2 LU off -14".

It prints the video it packed (`using ... (latest final)`) and writes `<job>/review/round-N/`: `sheet.jpg`
(a frame per second), `scenes.jpg` (every scene middle and each cut at -0.1 s, midpoint, +0.2 s), `cuts.jpg`
(every frame from 2 before to 4 after each cut, where double exposures and flashes hide), `frames/`
(frame 0, the hook at 0.5 s and 1.5 s, the poster, the last frame, scene frames; plus `text-<t>-<k>.png`,
the largest text lines of the key and scene frames cut out at full resolution for the type detail
pass), `loudness.png`,
`thumb-168x94.png`, a fresh `qa/` run, `context/` (brief, storyboard, SHOWTIME.md, showtime.json, check
report, mix report, the video's `.srt`/`.vtt`) and `CRITIC.md`, the brief to hand over (it carries the
eight questions of section 1). Other videos in the job (a 16:9 variant, exports) are listed in CRITIC.md
as "not in this pack": pack each deliverable you publish (`showtime review-pack <file>`; for a file
outside the job, such as a copied export, add `--project <dir>` so the pack gets its scenes and context).

Rounds count critic answers, not packs: a round is used once `FINDINGS.md` is saved in it. Until then
the next `review-pack` rebuilds the same round (for a newer final, or after an interrupted pack, which
carries an `INCOMPLETE` file). When a critic answers in chat, save its answer as `FINDINGS.md` in the
round folder before building the next round. Scenes are the planned ones (showtime.json `scenes` or
`chapters`, a film's `CUE.acts`, the page's scene clips, the voice timeline, the EDL report), named in the
frame labels; it says where they came from (`from <source>`) and falls back to detecting cuts in the pixels
only when there is no plan. Overlay clips (a kicker, a name card, a map inset shown during a scene) are not
scenes: `<section>`/`.scene` clips win when a page has them, otherwise a clip inside another clip's window
or an open-ended layer is left out; mark any other overlay with `data-overlay`. A film with DOM overlays
over its canvas is split by its `CUE.acts`.

**Pairwise pack (round 2 on).** `showtime review-pack <job> --against best` (or `--against round-N`, or an
older video file) pairs the latest render with the best version so far, blind: the two are `X` and `Y` at
random, with the same evidence for both at the same times (`X/` and `Y/`: sheet, frames at matched times, a
card past the shorter one's end, cut strips, text crops, loudness plot, `qa.txt`, `transcript.txt` of the
narration from its captions or voice timeline, else local speech recognition when only the other has one),
`compare-XY.jpg` / `compare-YX.jpg` side by side, and two briefs: `order-1/CRITIC.md` (X first) and
`order-2/CRITIC.md` (Y first). Nothing in the round names the files; the key is in
`<review>/.pairwise-keys/`, never handed to a critic. The context is only what the video was asked to be
(brief, storyboard, script, brand, credits), not the fix log.

## 3. Dispatch the critic

- Give the sub-agent only the path of `CRITIC.md` and ask it to write `FINDINGS.md` in the same folder.
  A pairwise round needs **two fresh critics**, dispatched at once, one per order, each given only its
  `order-N/CRITIC.md`; one critic judging both orders is not two judgments.
  With the plugin installed, dispatch the `showtime:critic` agent (brief: `crew/critic.md`); otherwise
  a general sub-agent told to read that brief. `crew.md` pattern D says when a studio job spends
  round 1 on the first look.
- **No sub-agent tool in this session** (you may be a sub-agent yourself): answer `CRITIC.md` yourself,
  in its format, into `FINDINGS.md`, starting with `SELF-REVIEW (no critic available)`. Look at every
  sheet, including `cuts.jpg`. Tell the user the review was a self-review and ask for a second pair of
  eyes before calling the video shipped: self-reviews rate real should-fix problems as polish.
  A self-answered pairwise round is not blind (you know which is new): `review-verdict` marks it; say so.
- Name a vision-capable model explicitly; the critic must look at the images.
- Do not tell it what to ignore or how severe things are. Coaching a reviewer toward "minor at most" is how
  real flaws ship.
- The critic is read-only: it does not edit, re-render, run the showtime workflow or dispatch other agents.

Severity, as CRITIC.md states it:
- **Blocker**: invented or wrong claims, misspelled names, black/frozen/garbage frames, wrong aspect or
  duration for the platform, clipped or missing voice, text cut off or outside the safe zone, missing credits.
- **Should-fix**: text too small or too brief to read, a line whose words and math (or numbers) sit on
  different baselines or differ in size or weight, music masking the voice, dead stretches over ~2 s,
  off-brand colours, captions more than ~150 ms out of sync.
- **Polish**: easing, 1-2 frame timing, colour nuance.

Every finding cites a timestamp and a frame path from the pack (in a pairwise round also its video, `[X]` or
`[Y]`). Findings without a location are dropped. **No scores**: a 1-10 rating from a model reviewer is noise;
the verdict, the preference and the findings carry the judgment.
The answer also lists what works, what the critic declined to judge, a verdict (ship / ship after fixes /
not ready), the absolute verdict (`WOULD I POST THIS: yes | no -- one reason`; pairwise: one per video) and
the best poster frame.

## 4. Act on the findings

1. Treat each finding as a claim. Snap the cited time (`showtime snap <project> --at t`, or
   `showtime snap <video.mp4> --at t` for a footage edit or the shipped file) and confirm the problem is there
   before changing anything. Critics are wrong sometimes too. Read a suggested script rewording in its full
   sentence before re-voicing it.
2. Fix blockers first, then should-fix items; polish only when it is cheap.
3. If you disagree with a finding, keep it and say why in your summary to the user; never drop it silently.
4. Fix, re-render (the next `final-N.mp4`; the job points at it), re-run `showtime check` after timing
   fixes (a shorter scene can break a label elsewhere), run `showtime qa <job>` again, and build round 2
   as a pairwise round: `showtime review-pack <job> --against best` (it follows the latest final). Text-only
   notes (a README line, share text) need no re-render and no new pack.
5. **Decide with `showtime review-verdict <job>`** once both orders' `FINDINGS.md` exist. The rule, in code:
   the new render is an improvement only when **preferred in both orders**; a tie or a split (the preference
   followed the position) is not, and the older one stays the best (`<review>/best.json`; `VERDICT.md` lists
   the best version's open findings). A losing render can leave the job with `showtime job discard`.
6. **The quality floor.** A pairwise round only asks "better than the last version?"; a better render can
   still look cheap. So every critic also answers `WOULD I POST THIS` on the video alone, and in quality
   mode a "no" (either pairwise critic's, for the winning render) keeps the review pending like "not ready"
   (`showtime qa <job>` names it). A should-fix or blocker that names captions or subtitles stays open, and
   pending, until a later round's critic writes a line naming the captions with `fixed`, or you write
   `won't fix: <reason>` about the captions in `review/round-N/RESPONSE.md` (plain word matching; lean
   mode only warns). `showtime qa` also warns on the four cheap looks it can see (`qa.md`, quality floor).
7. **Three rounds at most.** After round 3, ship the best version with its open findings listed; open
   blockers go to the user with frames, and they decide. `review-pack` refuses a fourth round unless
   `--force-round` is given.
8. **Polish after a "ship" verdict** needs no new pack: fix, then prove each fix with a before/after pair
   (`showtime snap <new.mp4> --at t1,t2 --compare <old.mp4>`), run `showtime qa`, and log it in
   `work/feedback.md`. An unused render is dropped from the job with `showtime job discard <job> <file>` (its poster, credits and `.work/` move with it to `work/discarded/`; caption files stay, name one to discard it too).

## 5. Notes from the user

1. **Echo them back numbered**, each tied to a timestamp or scene: "1. (0:03, scene 2) title too small ...".
   If a note is ambiguous ("make it punchier"), ask about that note only, offering 2-3 concrete readings with
   a recommended default, before changing anything.
2. **Apply in this order**: blockers (a wrong claim, a broken frame) → cheap tweaks (text, colour, timing) →
   structural changes (reordering scenes, new music). One change per re-render, affected range only.
3. **Show proof**: before/after stills at the cited timestamps (`showtime snap <new> --at t --compare <old>`),
   and the new qa verdict.
   State what changed and where; skip the praise.
4. **Push back when a note collides with a locked decision or a check**, e.g. six more lines of text in a
   3-second shot fails the reading-time rule, or a note contradicts a style frame the user approved. Say so,
   give the consequence, offer an alternative; the user decides.
5. **Log every round** in `work/feedback.md` inside the job folder:

```
## Round 2 (2026-09-26 14:10)
1. "logo too late" (0:13.5) -> moved the logo reveal from 13.5 s to 12.8 s; re-rendered 12-15 s
2. "music too loud under the voice" -> ducking depth 10 -> 14 dB; qa: -14.0 LUFS, TP -1.2
Not changed: "add the pricing table" (conflicts with the 15 s length; offered a 30 s cut)
```

Then record the boundary: `showtime job note --stage feedback --verified "round 2 applied: qa PASS"`.
