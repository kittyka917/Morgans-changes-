# Music: choosing, composing and syncing it to picture

Read this when you pick or compose music for a video: a produced track from the catalog, a composed
bed or none; which suits the tone, tempo and key; how to line sections up with the edit; and how to
end. The commands are in `audio.md`.

## Essentials

- Launch, trailer, story: a produced track (`showtime audio music pick --for launch --dur <len>`, then
  `{"kind": "music", "catalog": "<id>", "fit": true}`); explainer, tutorial, data: a restrained underscore or
  none; exact beats, stems: `showtime audio compose` (§0)
- "With music" on a video of 10 s or more with a mood (launch, birthday, recap, trailer, intro): a produced
  track is the default, on the film template too (a mix.json as `"audio"`; then trim score.js to its hits or
  set `"score": false`). `new film` writes each film its own score; `audio film-score <dir>` another (§0)
- You cannot listen: read `audio music info <id>` (moods, energy, vocals, `ending`, highlight); a short cut of
  a slow build: `"offset": "highlight"`; a disliked track: `audio music veto <id>` (§0)
- Never use Pixabay, Mixkit, Uppbeat, Bensound or YouTube Audio Library files, or anything NC or ND. Credits
  are automatic: write post copy above the Credits block in `share.txt`, never delete it (§0)
- Restraint reads as premium: explainers, data, reports, math and team videos get `underscore`,
  `minimal-pulse`, `ambient-pad`, `piano-emotional` or none; a bed under voice ducks 12 dB (§1)
- Unless asked, avoid plucked or mallet leads for serious work, claps at 110+ bpm under data, and `build` ->
  `drop` under charts; calm beds use `intro`, `verse`, `break`, `outro` (§1, §2)
- Produced track under a short film: `showtime audio cuts --for launch --dur 30 --scenes 5` puts scene changes
  on phrases (`--apply <project>` retimes the scenes) (§3)
- Composed: storyboard times as `--sections`; read `bed.beats.json` (`downbeats` for cuts, `events`,
  `end_hit`); cut picture 1–2 frames before the beat; tonal SFX get the music's `--key` (§2, §3)
- `phrase_flow` or a low `bpm_confidence`: do not hard-cut on the grid; fixed music: snap scene boundaries to
  the nearest downbeat (§3)
- End on a button: the logo exactly on `end_hit`; never fade out mid-phrase; library music:
  `audio fit --dur D` (`--ending song`) or a `logo-sting` with `align: hit` (§4)
- Keep style, bpm, key, sections and seed in the project notes so a later edit can regenerate it (§5)

## 0. Produced track, composed bed, or none

| The video | Music | How |
|---|---|---|
| launch, trailer, keynote opener, story, mission, thank-you, recap | a **produced catalog track** (a real recording) | `showtime audio music pick --for launch --dur <len>`, then `{"kind": "music", "catalog": "<id>", "fit": true}` in `audio/mix.json` |
| explainer, tutorial, data story, report, math | a restrained underscore: `--for explainer` / `--for data` (no vocals, low energy), a composed `underscore`, or none | same, ducked under the voice |
| picture that must land on exact beats, a sting on a given frame, stems, an exact length with sections on cuts | **the composer** | `showtime audio compose` (sections 2-4) |

- `--for` is one of launch, trailer, keynote, story, emotional, promo, social, product-demo, tech,
  explainer, tutorial, data, documentary, problem, background (`audio music presets`). Add `--mood`,
  `--energy 0.2-0.5` or words (`audio music search hopeful piano`). In a series, vary with `--n 1`, `--n 2`.
- Picks rotate: `pick`, `search` and `{"catalog": {"use": ...}}` rank tracks heard in the last 8 finished
  jobs lower (and, gently, composers of the last 3), and lists never let one composer take more than
  2 of 5 places in a row. `showtime history check` warns when a track or composer repeats a recent job
  and names two alternatives. An explicit id always wins; `showtime history off` or
  `SHOWTIME_MUSIC_ROTATION=off` turns rotation off.
- You cannot listen, so read `audio music info <id>`: moods, energy, vocals, `ending` (clean = ends on a
  hit and a ring-out; soft = a fade or a quiet outro; cut = still loud at the end), the length, a long
  quiet intro and the highlight. Every catalog track passed a measured quality gate (no muffled old
  recordings, hiss, crackle, clipping or dead gaps) and its energy and shelf were checked against the
  audio. For a video much shorter than a slow-building track, start at its peak:
  `{"kind": "music", "catalog": "<id>", "offset": "highlight", "fit": true}`.
  When the user dislikes a track, `audio music veto <id> --reason "..."` and pick again.
- A track is downloaded from its creator's site the first time it is used ("fetching X (N MB) for Y"),
  checked against its pinned sha256 and cached; cached tracks work offline. In an agent sandbox whose
  proxy blocks the creator's site, it comes from showtime's own audio mirror instead (same sha256
  check); `SHOWTIME_AUDIO_MIRROR` points at another mirror or folder, `off` disables it (see
  docs/agents.md).
- Credits are automatic: the mix records them, and `showtime render` writes `credits.txt`, a
  "Credits (keep in the video description)" block in `share.txt` and an optional end-card line, and
  prints a note for Scott Buckley tracks (his Smart Content ID claims YouTube videos whose
  description lacks the credit). Write the post copy above that block and never delete it.
- More than the catalog: `audio music openverse <words>` searches CC BY / CC0 audio on Freesound and
  Wikimedia Commons live (not curated, so preview first); `--fetch <id> -o <project>/audio` saves it with a
  `.license.json`, so it is credited. Jamendo is excluded by default (`--source jamendo` to ask): its own
  terms add conditions to commercial use and its licensing program can claim videos.
- Never use files from Pixabay, Mixkit, Uppbeat, Bensound or the YouTube Audio Library, or anything
  NC or ND: their licenses forbid this use.

## 1. Decide the job of the music first

| The music's job | Choose | Level in the mix |
|---|---|---|
| **Bed under voice-over** (explainer, tutorial, data story, report) | `underscore` (or `minimal-pulse` for tech), steady, no melody | ducked 12 dB under speech (default; `sound-design.md`) |
| **Air under silent visuals** (a no-voice explainer, math, chart story) | `underscore`, `ambient-pad` or `piano-emotional`; or no music at all | the only sound: keep it slow, dark and sparse |
| **Driver** (launch reel, hype cut, no voice) | a produced track (`--for launch` / `trailer`), or a clear composed pulse with sections that match the edit | the loudest element: -14 LUFS master, music ≈ everything |
| **Emotional carrier** (story, testimonial) | a produced piano or strings track (`--for story`), slow harmonic motion | under voice, swell in the gaps |
| **Punctuation** (logo sting, transition, bumper) | a stinger, a jingle, or a composed 3–6 s piece | a short peak at the moment |

**Taste rule: restraint reads as premium.** A viewer forgives no music; they do not forgive cheap
music. Explainers, data stories, reports, math and anything sent to a team or a boss get a
restrained bed (`underscore`, `minimal-pulse`, `ambient-pad`, `piano-emotional`) or none.
"Voice + two or three soft effects, no music" is a real option: say it in the opening line when
the piece is short, serious or already dense with narration. Restrained styles never add crashes,
drum fills, snare rolls, risers or reverse cymbals on their own.

**What not to pick unless the user asks for it** (these are what make a video sound like a cat
clip, a kids' game or a DIY stock-music video):
- bright plucked or mallet leads: glockenspiel, marimba, ukulele, pizzicato, whistles
  (`playful-pizzicato`, `retro-8bit`) for anything serious, technical or data-driven;
- major-key bounce with claps and a shaker at 110+ bpm (`corporate-minimal`, `acoustic-folk`)
  under a data story, a report or a proof;
- a `build` → `drop` section map under charts or equations: the snare roll and crash announce
  a climax the picture doesn't have. Calm pieces use `intro`, `verse`, `break`, `outro`;
- a busy melody under narration, or a different music gesture on every scene change;
- stacking pops, dings and chimes on a bed that already moves.

| Content | First choice | Also fine | Avoid |
|---|---|---|---|
| explainer or how-it-works, with voice | `underscore` | `minimal-pulse`, none | `corporate-minimal`, `playful-pizzicato` |
| data story, chart, report (HTML or MP4) | `underscore` | `minimal-pulse`, `ambient-pad`, none | anything with a drop |
| math, proof, science | `underscore` or `ambient-pad` at a low bpm | `piano-emotional`, none | pizzicato, 8-bit, claps |
| dev tool or technical walkthrough | `minimal-pulse` | `lofi-chill` (casual), none | `retro-8bit` unless the brand is retro |
| launch or promo with no voice | a catalog track (`music pick --for launch`) | `upbeat-tech`, `cinematic-build`, `minimal-pulse` (premium) when cuts must hit exact beats | `corporate-minimal` |
| company intro, upbeat feature tour | `corporate-minimal` | `acoustic-folk`, `minimal-pulse` | |
| kids, comedy, deliberately silly | `playful-pizzicato` | `retro-8bit`, `acoustic-folk` | |

## 2. Style catalog (`showtime audio styles`)

| Style | Default bpm / key | Feel | Good for | Bpm range that still works |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| underscore | 76 / Dm | documentary: strings, contrabass, soft piano pulse, no drums, no melody | explainers, data, reports, math (the default) | 64–88 |
| minimal-pulse | 92 / Am | modern: warm pad, sub bass, muted pluck ostinato, soft kick | tech and data explainers, walkthroughs | 84–104 |
| upbeat-tech | 124 / C | bright, modern, four-on-the-floor | launches, feature reels, SaaS | 110–128 |
| corporate-minimal | 104 / G | bright, positive, piano and strings, shaker | upbeat company intros | 96–112 |
| cinematic-build | 90 / Dm | orchestral build, toms, impact | reveals, keynote openers | 80–100 |
| epic-trailer | 84 / Cm | taiko, brass, choir, braams | trailers, big announcements | 70–95 |
| lofi-chill | 78 / F | swung boom-bap, Rhodes, crackle | study or dev vibes, relaxed tours | 70–90 |
| synthwave | 100 / Am | 80s arps, gated drums | retro tech, gaming, night | 90–118 |
| ambient-pad | 70 / E | drumless, spacious | beauty shots, meditative intros, math | any (no pulse) |
| playful-pizzicato | 116 / D | quirky, light, comic | comedy, kids (on request) | 100–130 |
| deep-house | 122 / Am | smooth minor 7ths, sub bass | lifestyle, fashion, recaps | 118–126 |
| hip-hop-beat | 90 / Cm | heavy kick and snare, 808 bass | bold social, creator content | 80–100 |
| acoustic-folk | 100 / G | strummed guitar, warm, human | small business, travel, craft | 88–116 |
| piano-emotional | 72 / C | tender, hopeful | testimonials, mission, thanks | 60–84 |
| dark-tension | 80 / Dm | pulsing strings, drone, heartbeat | problem statements, security, mystery | 70–90 |
| retro-8bit | 140 / C | chiptune | games, dev humour (on request) | 120–160 |
| news-bumper | 120 / D | urgent pulses, brass stabs | announcements, changelogs, weekly recaps | 110–130 |
| lounge-jazz | 112 / F | swing ride, walking bass, vibes | hospitality, laid-back tours | 100–130 |

Tone to style, as a first guess:
- **polished / premium / serious:** underscore, minimal-pulse, ambient-pad, piano-emotional
- **default / technical:** minimal-pulse, upbeat-tech (launch energy)
- **playful / light (asked for):** playful-pizzicato, retro-8bit, acoustic-folk
- **cinematic / epic:** cinematic-build, epic-trailer
- **urgent / news:** news-bumper
- **cozy / dev:** lofi-chill
- **emotional:** piano-emotional
- **dark / problem:** dark-tension, then switch style (or key: minor to major) for the solution

Sections for calm beds: `intro`, `verse`, `break`, `outro` (energy follows the scenes without a
climax). Keep `build` and `drop` for pieces whose picture really builds and lands.

Keys:
- Minor keys read darker. Relative-major pairs (Am/C, Em/G, Dm/F) let a problem→solution video
  move from minor to major with the same notes.
- Keep effects in the music's key: pass the same `--key` to tonal SFX.

Tempo:
- 60–80 bpm is calm or emotional, 90–110 is confident and conversational, 110–130 is energetic,
  above 130 is hyper.
- Busy visuals want a slower bed. Sparse visuals can take a faster one.

Catalog, composer or library?
- **Catalog** (produced recordings, section 0) when the music should sound produced and human, which
  is most launches, trailers and emotional pieces. `"fit": true` loops or trims it on bar lines; cut
  the picture to its beats (the mix report lists `downbeats` and `end_hit`).
- **Compose** when the edit has fixed beats that the music must hit (section changes, a logo at
  a time, an exact length) or you need stems. Structure is exact, sound is good but synthetic.
- **Both**: a catalog bed with composed or procedural stingers and risers in the same key.
- **The installed library** (`audio lib search --kind music`) is mostly light Kevin MacLeod pieces
  and CC0 game music: for serious work search calm, ambient, cinematic or piano moods, read the title
  and tags, and skip anything quirky, funny, ukulele, whistle, circus or kids.

## 3. Sync music to the edit

**A produced track under a short film (launch, promo, trailer, recap): let the music set the cuts.**
`showtime audio cuts [id|file] --for launch --dur 30 --scenes 5` analyses the track once (beats, bars,
4-bar phrases, loudness every 0.5 s, the lifts where it steps up), picks the excerpt that starts calm,
has somewhere to go and swells where the end card starts, and puts each scene change on a phrase
start (else a half-phrase or a bar line). It prints the plan: the excerpt, the scene starts, how many
changes sit on phrases or swells, the dynamics. `--apply <project>` also moves the scenes there
(`retime --cuts`) and writes the excerpt as the project's music track (`offset`, `dur`, fades);
`--offset` keeps an excerpt you chose; `--end-card` and `--hook` set those lengths. Premium launch
beds sit quiet with swells (the excerpt's 10th-90th percentile spread of 5-10 dB); `qa` warns when the
master moves less than 3 dB.

**Composed music or a fixed edit:**

1. Decide the section map from the storyboard: where the hook lands, where the demo builds, where
   the reveal drops, where the call to action sits.
2. Compose with those times as `--sections`. Every marker is a downbeat, so the section change,
   the riser landing and the impact all land on your cut.
3. Read `bed.beats.json`:
   - `downbeats` are where hard cuts can go.
   - `beats` are for text pops (60–70 % on the grid feels musical; 100 % feels mechanical).
   - `events` gives riser_end, impact and end_hit times.
4. Cut picture **1–2 frames before** the beat (33–66 ms at 30 fps). Sound slightly after picture
   feels tight. Sound before picture feels wrong.
5. The cutting rate follows the energy:
   - calm sections: a cut every 2 bars
   - builds: every bar
   - drops: every beat or half beat, for a short burst only
6. For library music, run `audio beats`.
   - When `pacing` is `phrase_flow`, don't hard-cut on the grid: cut on energy changes (`moments`)
     and phrase starts.
   - When `bpm_confidence` is low, snap only the 1–3 biggest moments.
7. If the music is fixed (for example a licensed track), move the cuts instead: snap each scene
   boundary to the nearest downbeat within half a beat.

## 4. Endings

- **End on a button:** a final hit on the logo, then 1–3 s of ring-out. Composed music does this
  by construction: `end_hit` is the time of the hit. Put the logo reveal exactly there, or on the
  downbeat before it.
- **Library music:**
  - `audio fit --dur D` loops on bar lines to stretch, or trims to end after a downbeat with a
    short decay. It prints the bar it ends on and says "ends mid-phrase" when the cut is not on a
    4-bar boundary. `--ending song` keeps the track's own ending instead: its last two bars (the
    cadence and the final hit) are spliced in at a downbeat, so a 110 s track cut to 45 s still ends
    on its real cadence (`end_hit` in the JSON output is where the final hit lands).
  - To end on a precise hit, fit the bed a little short, then add a stinger (`--kind stinger`), or
    `audio sfx logo-sting --key <key>` with `align: hit` on the logo time. Library tracks rarely
    have a button ending; a synthesized `logo-sting` in the bed's key (from its `beats.json` `key`)
    is the reliable one: `showtime audio lib search --kind stinger --key C` for library stings.
  - `audio fit --from 42` starts inside the track (the chorus, the loud part) on the nearest
    downbeat. In a mix, a `fit: true` track honours `offset` the same way: the fit and its downbeat
    grid start at the offset.
- **Never fade out in the middle of a phrase** because the video ran out. Change the edit or the
  music length instead.
- A 0.25–0.5 s near-silence before the final hit (a pre-drop gap) makes the logo land harder.
  Composed builds already include one for most styles.

## 5. Iterate cheaply

- Compose drafts at the real length but listen to the stems when something is off:
  `bed.stems/lead.wav` too busy under voice? Re-seed (`--seed 2`), change the style, or remove the
  drop (fewer sections with a lead).
- Loudness is always -14 LUFS after mastering. Judge balance and arrangement, not volume.
- Keep the chosen style, bpm, key, sections and seed in the project notes, so a later edit can
  regenerate exactly the same music at a new length.
