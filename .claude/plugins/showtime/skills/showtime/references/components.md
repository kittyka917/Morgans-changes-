# Motion components: API, options and examples (runtime/components)

Read this when you are building an HTML/DOM video page (`showtime new dom|short|data`) and want
titles, captions, lower thirds, stats, charts, code, browser or device frames, a cursor, chat or
notification UI, a checklist, a Ken Burns still, a map or an end card. For scene-to-scene
handoffs read `references/transitions.md`; for timing and taste read `references/motion-craft.md`.
Run `showtime motion` for the live list.

## Essentials

- Setup: `/_st/stage.js`, a theme CSS, then `/_st/components/index.js` as a module. Any element with
  `data-st="<component>"` mounts itself; options are kebab-case `data-*` (`data-exit-at` = `exitAt`) or JSON (§1)
- `at` is seconds local to the clip the component sits in (the nearest ancestor with `data-start`); every other
  time option (`cues`, `exitAt`, `path[].at`, `states[].at` ...) counts from the component's `at` (§1)
- A title already on screen at t=0: `data-style="none"` (kinetic-type), never a negative `at` (it shifts every
  exit too) (§1)
- Seek-safe: components are pure functions of time, with no timers, CSS transitions or accumulated state; your
  own components follow the same rules (compute from `lt`, measure in `setup` only) (§1, §8)
- Size in container units (`cqw`, `cqh`, `cqmin`) so one page works at 16:9, 9:16 and 1:1; a padded `.scene`
  shrinks them, so set `.scene { padding: 0 }` or pad an inner wrapper (§1)
- Frame-exact cuts: `data-start`/`data-dur` within 1 ms of a frame boundary land on it (`7.0667` is frame 212 at
  30 fps), so write beat-synced cuts with 4 decimals (§1)
- Put SFX and narration on `sync` beats (`count-up.sync.land`, `cursor.sync.click1`) after `await c.ready`; videos
  inside components are muted `<video data-st>` (§1)
- Where options live: `kinetic-type`, `typewriter`, `caption-karaoke` §2; `lower-third`, `count-up`, `steps` §3;
  `chart`, `world-map` §4; `browser-frame`, `device-frame`, `cursor`, `keystrokes`, `code-block`, `chat-thread`,
  `notifications`, `feature-grid` §5; `camera`, `fit`, `portal`, `ken-burns`, `logo-reveal`, `end-card`, `grain`
  §6; themes and tokens §7; writing your own §8. Live list: `showtime motion`
- `caption-karaoke`: `clean-pop` is the default and the style for 9:16 shorts; 3-5 `emphasis` words, not more;
  place the layer outside the scenes so it runs across cuts (§2)
- `count-up` and `chart` take real numbers only; the chart title is the takeaway computed from the data; keep
  numbers in a `src` JSON file; a chart needs a sized box (§3, §4)
- Keep chart `valueLabels` on its auto-thinning default (`"all"` triggers `labels_crowded`); past ~12 labelled
  bars (~6 at 9:16) label only the highlight and extremes, aggregate, or use a `line` chart (§4)
- Chart from a table: `showtime data import <table> <project> --x <col> --y <col> --scene <id>` (§4)
- Capture pages at the device's real viewport; code panels from `showtime code file.ts -o code.json` with a shiki
  theme whose comments clear 4.5:1 (`showtime check` judges every token) (§5)
- Chat and notification UI stays generic (never a real app's branding); no emoji icons (§5)
- `end-card` holds >= 2.5 s; a 5-6 % `camera` push onto a result is the premium move (§6)

## 1. Setup (two lines) and the time model

```html
<script src="/_st/stage.js"></script>                                  <!-- the time contract -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/_st/themes/neutral.css">                  <!-- colours, fonts, motion feel -->
<script type="module" src="/_st/components/index.js"></script>         <!-- every component, auto-mounted -->

<section class="scene" data-start="0" data-dur="4">
  <h1 class="t-display" data-st="kinetic-type" data-style="blur" data-at="0.2">Hello</h1>
</section>
```

- **Mounting.** Any element with `data-st="<component>"` mounts itself. Options are `data-*`
  attributes in kebab-case (`data-exit-at` = `exitAt`); arrays and objects are JSON. Or mount from
  JS: `import { KineticType } from '/_st/components/index.js'; KineticType('#title', { style: 'blur' })`.
  A JSON blob works too: `data-options='{"style":"blur","at":0.2}'`.
- **Time.** `at` is when the component starts, in seconds **local to the clip** it sits in (the
  nearest ancestor with `data-start`; composition time outside any clip). Every other time option
  (`cues`, `exitAt`, `path[].at`, `highlight[].at`, `states[].at` ...) counts **from the component's
  `at`**: with the default `at: 0` that is clip time, but `data-at="0.6" data-exit-at="5"` exits at
  5.6 s into the clip. To have a title already on screen at t=0, use `data-style="none"` (kinetic-type)
  rather than a negative `at` (which shifts every exit time too).
- **Seek-safe.** Components are pure functions of time: they set inline styles on every seek and
  never use timers, CSS transitions or accumulated state, so any frame renders alone, in any order.
  They measure once, after their fonts load and with their clip forced visible.
- **Sync points.** Each controller exposes `sync` (composition seconds of named beats, e.g.
  `count-up.sync.land`, `cursor.sync.click1`) to line up SFX or narration:
  `const c = CountUp('#n', {...}); await c.ready; c.sync.land`.
- **Sizing.** Everything is in container units (`cqw`, `cqh`, `cqmin`). `.stage` and `.scene` are
  size containers, so the same page works at 16:9, 9:16 and 1:1. Tall frames can switch layout with
  `@container (max-aspect-ratio: 5/6) { ... }`. Container units measure the content box: a `.scene`
  with padding makes `90cqh` 90 % of the padded box, not of the frame (set `.scene { padding: 0 }`
  or pad an inner wrapper when you place things by frame percentages).
- **Frame-exact cuts.** `data-start`/`data-dur` values within 1 ms of a frame boundary land on that
  frame (`7.0667` is frame 212 at 30 fps), so beat-synced cuts can be written with 4 decimals.
- **Styling.** Components read theme tokens (`--accent`, `--font-display`, `--radius` ...) with
  fallbacks; component CSS loads first, so your page CSS wins. Class names are `st-<component>-*`.
- **Media.** Images and videos inside components are awaited before the first frame. Videos must be
  muted `<video data-st>` (the stage seeks them).

Helpers exported by `/_st/components/index.js` (from `core.js`): `ease(name)` (`'power3.out'`,
`'expo.inOut'`, `'spring(0.5,0.8)'`, `'glide'`, `'steps(6)'`, `'cubic-bezier(...)'`, named
`premium|standard|emphasized|exit|camera`), `spring(response, damping)`, `seg(t, start, dur, ease)`,
`envelope(t, {start, in, end, out})`, `stagger(i, n, each, {cap, from})`, `hash(i, seed)`, `rng(seed)`,
`noise1(x, seed)`, `splitText(el)`, `define({name, defaults, setup})` to write your own component.

## 2. Text

### kinetic-type
Split a headline into words, characters or lines and reveal with a stagger (total stagger capped).
| option | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `style` | `rise` | `rise` `mask` (slides up from behind a clip) `blur` `pop` (spring) `slide` `drop` `swing` (3D flip up) `track` (letters converge) `scramble` (glyphs cycle then lock) `fade` `none` (on screen from the start; exits still apply) |
| `by` | `words` | `words` `chars` `lines` (per-letter only for 1-3 word heroes) |
| `dur`, `stagger`, `cap` | theme | per-unit entrance time, gap between units, max total stagger (0.6 s) |
| `from` | `start` | `start` `end` `center` `edges` `random` |
| `ease` | per style | any ease name |
| `distance`, `blur` | 0.55, 0.18 | travel and blur in em |
| `accent` | | comma list of words to colour with `--accent` (`<em>` works too) |
| `cues` | | array of start times per unit (lock words to narration word times) |
| `exit`, `exitAt`, `exitDur`, `hold` | `none` | `fade` `rise` `drop` `blur` `mask`; exit at `exitAt` (counted from `at`), or `hold` s after landing, or at the clip end |
```html
<h1 class="t-hero" data-st="kinetic-type" data-style="mask" data-accent="faster">Ship faster</h1>
```

### typewriter
Typed text with a human or uniform cadence; caret solid while typing, blinking when idle.
Options: `text` (default: the element's text), `script` (`[{type:'...'},{pause:0.3},{back:4}]` for
typos and corrections), `cadence` `human|uniform`, `cps` 18, `fit` (seconds to finish by),
`caret` `bar|block|underline|none`, `blink` 1.06, `hideCaretAfter`, `linePause` 0.35, `seed`.
```html
<p class="t-mono" data-st="typewriter" data-fit="2.5">npx showtime render launch</p>
```

### caption-karaoke
Word-timed captions grouped into readable cards, spoken word highlighted, placed in the safe zone.
Input: `src` (JSON URL) or `words`: a showtime transcript, the voice module's `*.words.json`, or
any `[{text, start, end}]` (`type` other than `word` is skipped; `emph: true` marks emphasis).
| option | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `style` | `clean-pop` | `clean-pop` (sentence-case heavy sans, thin edge and soft shadow, spoken word turns the accent: the default, and the right one for 9:16 shorts), `bold-pop` (outlined heavy caps, spoken word pops slightly in the accent: loud, hype pieces), `highlight-box` (accent box glides behind the word), `underline-sweep` (bar sweeps under the word as it is said), `minimal` (subtitle, upcoming words dimmed), `boxed-pill` (card on a rounded plate), `fill` (each word fills left to right) |
| `position` | `auto` | `auto` (9:16: `lower`; 16:9: 10 % above the bottom), `top` `center` `lower` (the block hangs from 62 % height, so a two-line card grows down, never up into the content; lifted only if it would pass the safe bottom) `bottom` |
| `maxWords`, `maxChars` | per style / fit | card limits (clean-pop 5, bold-pop 4 words; cards aim for about one word fewer); `maxChars` = two lines of what fits the width, at most 32 characters a line on 9:16 (42 otherwise) |
| `gap` | 0.3 | a pause longer than this starts a new card |
| `emphasis` | | comma list of the 3-5 words that carry the message, coloured in the accent (no scale). At most one shows per card (the first); more than 5 shown (or one per 6 s in longer videos) is a `check` warning, because an accent on every term means nothing. Terms match letters and digits (`2.0`, `--unique`) |
| `size` | 1 | font scale; `upper` forces uppercase on/off; `holdLast` 0.8 s; `plate` colour |
| `keep` | | comma list of phrases never split across cards or lines (`"Command K,Command E"`); each word keeps its own highlight time |
| `skipLines` | | comma list of voice line ids whose words are not captioned (the title already says it); survives `retime --from-voice`. A word with `"hidden": true` in the words file is skipped too |
| `group` | `words` | `phrase`: cards break only at punctuation and pauses (up to 8 words on 2 lines, at least 1 s each), for fast speech (Spanish at ~3.5 words/s gave 0.4 s cards) |
| `minShow` | 0.4 | a card shorter than this joins a neighbour (fast speech would otherwise flash "HIT N" for 0.27 s); a card that still cannot merge is a `check` warning |
Grouping: a sentence end or a pause longer than `gap` always ends a card; inside a sentence the
split is chosen as a whole: cards near the target size, on screen at least `minShow`, breaking at
commas and breaths, and never ending on a weak word (articles, prepositions, conjunctions,
auxiliaries: "empty lines before" / "sorting." becomes "clears empty lines" / "before sorting.";
English plus common Spanish, French, Portuguese and German ones). One-word cards are avoided; cards
never overlap; each card shows from its first word − 0.05 s to its last word + 0.35 s. Lines use
`text-wrap: balance`; a weak word stays on the line of the word after it, and a short token ("K")
can still strand away from its modifier: list such pairs in `keep`. Theme tokens:
`--cap-font --cap-weight --cap-ink --cap-accent --cap-outline --cap-plate --cap-active-ink`. The
edge, glow and drop shadow are all made from `--cap-outline`, so on a light ground set a dark ink and a
light outline (as `paper` does) and the words stay crisp; the accent must pass 4.5:1 on the ground.
For a light 9:16 short, `boxed-pill` (a plate behind the card) reads best.
Put the layer outside the scenes so it runs across cuts; it is marked `data-caption` for QA.
```html
<div data-st="caption-karaoke" data-src="voice/vo.words.json" data-style="highlight-box" data-at="0.6"></div>
```

## 3. Identification and numbers

### lower-third
`variant` `bar|card|kicker|pill`, `name`, `role`, `kicker` (label for `kicker`), `avatar` (image for
`pill`), `side` `left|right`, `hold` (seconds on screen after landing; default: until near the clip
end), `exit` true, `in` (entrance seconds; default 0.85, kicker 1.0), `position` `auto|top|none`
(`top`: under the safe top, for 9:16 videos whose captions sit in the lower half; none = place it
yourself). In 9:16 the type is larger (name 6.4cqmin, role 4cqmin) so it reads on a phone.
```html
<div data-st="lower-third" data-variant="card" data-name="Ada Park" data-role="Staff engineer" data-at="1"></div>
```

### count-up
`value`, `from` 0, `decimals`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `label`, `dur` 1.6, `ease` `power3.out`,
`compact` (12.8k), `group`, `variant` `plain|ring|bar`, `of` (ring/bar total; default 100 for %),
`pulse`, `align`, `locale` (number format; default the page's `<html lang>`, so a Spanish page shows
13,7 and 60.000; chart takes it too), `suffixAlign` (`auto`: a suffix starting with ° sits at the top of the figure, so
"°C" never reads as "◦C"; `top`, `baseline`). The number's box reserves the widest value the count
shows in the real font, so proportional display figures never run into the suffix. Size with
`--cu-size` (figure) and `--cu-ring`. Sync: `land`. Use real numbers only.
Prefix and suffix sit tight against the number ("+160%", not "+ 160 %").
```html
<div data-st="count-up" data-value="71" data-suffix="%" data-variant="ring" data-label="of Earth's surface is ocean"></div>
```

### steps
`steps` (array or comma list), `variant` `dots|bar|list`, `cues` (times each step activates; list
items tick on their own cue), or `first` 0.4 + `every` 1.2.

## 4. Data

### chart
Bar, horizontal-bar and line charts with a story: grow/draw on, highlight one datum, callout.
| option | meaning |
|---|---|
| `type` | `bar` `hbar` (ranked rows that re-order smoothly) `line` |
| `src` | JSON file with any of the options below (recommended: keep numbers out of HTML) |
| `data` | bars: `[{label, value}]`; lines: `{labels: [...], series: [{name, values, color?}]}` |
| `states` | `[{at, data, title?}]`: morph to new data (axis rescales first, then marks move); a title that changes only after " · " (a race's year) swaps without fading |
| `title`, `subtitle` | write the takeaway as the title, computed from the data, never invented (illustration with made-up sample values 42 → 11 min: (42 − 11) / 42 = 74%, so "Median build time fell 74%") |
| `highlight` | label (bar) or series name (line) in the accent; the rest muted |
| `annotate` | `{label | index, text, at?}` callout after the marks settle |
| `prefix`, `suffix`, `decimals`, `compact`, `yMax`, `yMin`, `ticks` 4, `locale`, `grow` 0.9, `draw` 1.6, `curve` `monotone|linear` |
| `valueLabels` | `true` (auto): bar labels that would come closer than 0.3em shrink a little (never below 0.8x or the chart's minimum font), then the least important hide (the highlighted, annotated, max, min, last and first stay; the rest by size of value; a label that would sit on a neighbouring bar hides too), planned per state so they fade with a morph instead of flickering; `"all"` shows every label however crowded (`showtime check` then reports `labels_crowded`); `false` hides them (hbar races included) |
| `count` | `true`; `false` shows each value label at its real value, fading in as the bar lands (no "+0.69" mid-count on a paused frame) |
| `highlightAt` | `start`; `settled` colours the highlighted bar only once the bars have landed |
| `ref` | `{value, label, sub?, at?}`: a dashed reference line (a target, "next warmest: 2014, +0.75") drawn on after the marks settle |
| `dots` | `auto` (line points up to 40), `true`, `false` |
Negative values work in every type: the axis reaches below zero, a zero line appears and bars grow
down (anomalies, deltas, profit/loss); the axis leaves room under the lowest bar for its value label,
so it never sits on the category labels (unless `yMin` is set). A `prefix` of `+` signs values (`+1.29`, `−0.49`). Options in
the `src` file apply unless the element sets them (`data-*` or `data-options`), so `decimals` from
`data import` is honoured; tick labels carry the decimals their step needs (0, 0.5, 1.0). hbar rows
rank by value (ties keep the data order) and glide only while a state change runs. A single line
series' end label shows the value only (the title names it). `--chart-muted` can be a theme token
on `:root`.
Needs a sized box (e.g. `position:absolute; inset:...`). Sync: `settled`, `callout`, `ref`, `state2`...
Axis, value and subtitle labels never go below 2.7vmin (29 px at 1080p, readable on a phone); set
`--chart-min-font` lower only for a small inset chart. An `annotate` callout sits above its bar's
value label and any neighbour label under it, and the y axis leaves headroom for it. An hbar value
label that a `ref` line would strike through slides past the line as it draws on.
Many bars: category labels wider than their slot show every n-th (plus the last, highlighted and
annotated ones). Past ~12 labelled bars (or ~6 in 9:16) a value on every bar is noise: keep the
default auto-thinning, label only the highlight and the extremes, aggregate (decades instead of
years), or use a `line` chart whose end label carries the latest value.
From a CSV or JSON table: `showtime data import <table> <project> --x <col> --y <col> --scene <id>`
writes the chart file and points that scene's chart at it (`workflows/data-story.md`).

### world-map
World map or globe (Natural Earth 110m via `world-atlas`, d3-geo). `projection`
`naturalEarth|equalEarth|mercator|orthographic`, `spin` (deg/s, globe), `camera`
`[{at, center:[lon,lat], zoom, dur}]`, `highlight` `[{at, names:[...]|ids:[...], color?}]`,
`markers` `[{at, lon, lat, label}]`, `routes` `[{at, from:[lon,lat], to:[lon,lat], dur}]`,
`graticule`, `labels`, `src`/`object` for other TopoJSON/GeoJSON. Country names are the Natural
Earth names ("United States of America", "France").
One country (a regional map): `projection` `mercator` (conformal: the right shape at high latitude),
`src` the 50m file, and the zoom that fills a fraction `f` of the frame width with the country's
longitude span `L`: `zoom = f * W / ((L / 360) * min(W, H))` (Mercator's fit makes the world
`min(W, H)` wide). Routes are single great-circle legs: split a multi-stop route into legs with their
own `at`. A marker's "current/visited" state is a class you toggle on `.st-map-marker` from
`ST.onSeek`; to put a label left of its dot, set `text-anchor: end` in page CSS.

## 5. Product and UI

### browser-frame / device-frame
Brand-free chrome around a screenshot, a video or live HTML children. The URL bar uses the theme's
`--font-body`; on a page without a theme (a canvas film with DOM layers) set `--font-body` and link
a font file (`/_st/themes/fonts/inter.css`), or the bar falls back to the OS UI font.
Shared: `src` (image or video), `scroll` `[{at, to, dur}]` (`to` 0..1 fraction, pixels, or `#id`),
`zoom` `[{at, scale, x, y, dur}]` (camera push to x/y %), `camera` `page|frame` (`page`: the push
happens inside fixed chrome; `frame`: the whole window scales, chrome included, and its edges leave
the picture, which reads better than a page sliding under a pinned URL bar), `tilt` `[rx, ry]`
degrees, `enter` `rise|none`, `float`. Children given together with `src` stay as an overlay above
the screenshot (a highlight ring, a cursor target) and move with its scroll and zoom. Scroll
targets are measured once the image has decoded; a step that cannot move (the page is not taller
than the view) is a `check` warning. A full-page capture scrolls a flat image, so a sticky nav slides
away with it: cut the nav strip from the capture and pin it as a child if the real page keeps it.
browser-frame: `url`, `typeUrl` (types the URL), `title`, `theme` `auto|light|dark`.
device-frame: `model` `phone|tablet|laptop`, `color` `graphite|silver`, `notch`.
`drift` `auto|none|<scale per second>`: a still screenshot (`src` image) with no `scroll` or `zoom`
steps gets a slow push-in by default (+1.2 %/s, capped at +8 %), so the shot is never a frozen frame;
`none` turns it off (check then flags the hold). A cursor path or a scroll still reads better.
Capture pages at the device's real viewport (a desktop page squeezed into a phone looks wrong).
```html
<div data-st="browser-frame" data-url="acme.dev/pricing" data-src="shots/pricing.png"
     data-scroll='[{"at":1.5,"to":0.6,"dur":2}]' style="position:absolute;inset:10% 12%"></div>
```

### cursor and keystrokes
cursor: `path` `[{at, x, y} | {at, target:"#sel", dx, dy, click, hover}]` (x/y in % of the
cursor layer; targets are tracked live, so it follows tilted or moving UI), `style`
`arrow|hand|dot`, `size` 3.4 (cqmin), `arc` 0.12, `hideAfter`. It arrives exactly at each `at`;
clicks press the target (CSS `scale`) and ripple; `hover` sets `[data-st-hover]` on the target.
keystrokes: `items` `[{at, keys:"⌘ K"} | {at, text:"deploy"}]`, `hold` 1.5. `⌘ ⇧ ⌥ ⌃ ↵ ⌫ ⇥ ← → ↑ ↓`
are drawn as SVG so they look the same on every OS.
```html
<div data-st="cursor" data-path='[{"at":0,"x":85,"y":90},{"at":1.2,"target":"#buy","click":true}]'></div>
```

### code-block
Editor panel from `showtime code file.ts -o code.json` tokens (offline shiki; 65 themes).
`src`/`tokens`/`code` (plain text fallback), `title`, `chrome` `window|none`, `lineNumbers`,
`reveal` `lines|type|none`, `cps` 45 / `fit` (typing), `highlight` `[{lines:"4-6", at, color?}]`,
`diffAt` + `diffDur` 0.7 (with `showtime code old.ts --to new.ts`: removed lines flash red and
collapse, added lines open green), `focus` `[{line, at, dur}]` (scroll), `size` (cqmin), `dim` 0.35,
`firstLine` (an excerpt keeps its file's numbers: `data-first-line="258"` shows 258, 259, ... and
`highlight`/`focus` take those numbers).
Line numbers are 1-based and, for diffs, count the new file. Line numbers and diff gutters clear
4.5:1 on the default panel (`--code-ln-opacity` 0.62, `--code-add`, `--code-del`); pick a shiki theme
whose comments and punctuation also clear it (`houston` does; `vitesse-dark` draws comments at
#666666), since `showtime check` judges every token.

### chat-thread / notifications
chat-thread: `messages` `[{from:'me'|'them'|name, text, at?, stream?}]`, `typing` 0.9 s indicator
before replies, `gap`, `speed`, `names`. Auto-timed by reading time; scrolls as it fills.
notifications: `items` `[{app, title, text, icon?, time?, at?}]`, `every` 0.9, `max` 4 visible,
`top` (a CSS length or % of the frame; a `top` in the page CSS also wins over the safe-area default).
Generic UI only: do not imitate a real app's branding.

### feature-grid
`items` `[{icon, title, text}]` or existing children, `columns` (auto by aspect), `focus`
`[{at, index}]` spotlight, `stagger`, `cap` 0.55 (the whole stagger's ceiling in seconds; raise it
to land each card on its own beat), `dim`. Icons: `.svg` path (inlined, takes the accent; e.g.
`/_lib/lucide-static/icons/zap.svg`), raw `<svg>`, image, or text. Avoid emoji (they render
with each OS's own font).

## 6. Camera, stills, closers, texture

- **camera**: a scene camera over the content it wraps (put it at `position:absolute; inset:0` around
  the scene's content). `path` `[{at, dur, zoom, focus, to, ease}]`: `at` seconds from the scene start,
  `dur` the move (0 = a cut to that framing), `zoom` (1 = as laid out), `focus` a selector inside the
  camera or `[x%, y%]` (the point looked at), `to` `[x%, y%]` where it lands on screen (default the
  centre), `ease` (default `camera`). Zoom is interpolated in log space and the focus with the same
  curve, so a push reads even. `contain` (default true): at zoom >= 1 the content always covers the
  frame. `drift` (zoom per second after the last move, capped at +6 %): holds keep breathing;
  `data-drift="hold"` is the documented hold push, 0.012 (1.2 %/s), which `check` and qa's `frozen`
  detector both count as change on light and dark text frames (0.8 %/s is borderline, 0.4 %/s fails check). Children
  with `data-depth="k"` that fill the camera move k times as much (0.3 = a far layer: parallax).
  `keepText` (default true): while the camera moves, the union of the visible text stays inside the
  frame (the feed-safe box at 9:16), so a push never crops a headline; between moves (with `drift` 0,
  the default) the transform sits on whole pixels so type does not shimmer. `to: "stay"` zooms about
  the focus where it is laid out. A 5-6 % push onto a result is the premium move; `through`/`match`/`pan`
  (`transitions.md`) carry the camera from one scene to the next.
- **fit**: `data-st="fit"` on a terminal, a code line or a command pill: the type shrinks until the
  longest line fits the box (and the lines fit its height) at the frame size of the run, down to `min`
  (0.55); below that, lines wrap with a hanging indent. Measured once, after the components inside it.
  ```html
  <div class="cam" data-st="camera" data-drift="0.004"
       data-path='[{"at":0,"zoom":1},{"at":3,"dur":1.6,"focus":".out","zoom":1.08}]'>...</div>
  ```
- **portal** (for the `through` transition): `data-portal` on any element makes its box the opening;
  `data-portal="counter"` on a single letter (`<span data-portal="counter">o</span>`) makes the glyph's
  enclosed hole the opening (measured from the real font).
- **ken-burns**: `src` or child media, `from`/`to` `{scale, x, y}` (x/y %), or `focus` `[x%, y%]` +
  `zoom` 1.1, `dur` (default clip length), `ease` `sine.inOut`, `fit` (`cover`; `contain` shows the
  whole image; page CSS on `.st-kb-media` works too), `fade` (default: none when the shot starts with
  its scene, so beat cuts stay hard cuts; 0.4 s when it appears mid-scene with `at` > 0), `mask` (a CSS
  mask image applied to the moving picture, so it scales with the zoom; a mask on the wrapper stays
  fixed while the picture grows under it).
- **logo-reveal**: `text` (wordmark) or a child `<img>`/`<svg>`, `style`
  `assemble|mask|blur|draw` (draw needs inline SVG paths), `dot` (accent full stop), `bloom` (false:
  no accent glow as it lands; end-card takes it too).
- **end-card**: logo reveal + `tagline` + `cta` pill + `url`; hold >= 2.5 s. `logo` (image URL) or a
  child img/svg plus `text` shows the mark next to the name (stacked in tall frames): the mark
  resolves first, the name follows. A mark alone resolves with `blur` (`style` `mask|blur|draw`).
  Sizes: `--logo-mark-size` (default 16cqmin alone, 1.1x `--logo-size` next to the name).
- **grain**: seeded film grain over the frame; `opacity` (default `--grain`), `fps` 24, `size`,
  `blend`. Keeps dark gradients from banding after compression.

## 7. Themes (runtime/themes)

`neutral` (light product), `bold` (loud launch), `editorial` (magazine, calm), `neon`
(night tech), `paper` (hand-made explainer), `terminal` (developer console). One `<link>` each.
Token contract: palette `--bg --fg --muted --surface --surface-2 --border --accent --accent-2
--accent-ink --good --bad --shadow`; type `--font-display --font-body --font-mono --font-hand
--weight-display --weight-body --tracking-display --leading-display --case-display`; shape/space
`--radius --radius-lg --stroke --space-1..4 --safe-x --safe-y`; motion `--motion-energy
--dur-in --dur-out --dur-beat --stagger --ease-in --ease-out --ease-move --ease-emph`; captions
`--cap-*`; texture `--grain --glow`. Override any token on `:root` or a scene for a brand.
Layout classes from `base.css`: `.stage .scene .layer .safe .center .stack .row`, type
`.t-hero .t-display .t-title .t-sub .t-body .t-label .t-mono .t-num`, `.accent .muted .surface
.glow .vignette`. Fonts are local files (Fontsource packages); each theme loads only its own
families, `themes/fonts.css` loads them all, `themes/fonts/noto-sans-jp.css` adds Japanese.

## 8. Writing your own component

```js
import { define, seg, ease } from '/_st/components/index.js';
export const Badge = define({
  name: 'badge', defaults: { at: 0, text: 'NEW' },
  setup(el, o) {                    // runs once, fonts loaded, clip visible
    el.textContent = o.text;
    const E = ease('spring(0.4,0.6)');
    return { duration: 0.5, update(lt) { el.style.transform = `scale(${E(seg(lt, 0, 0.5))})`; } };
  },
});
```
Rules: compute everything from `lt` (local seconds); no `setTimeout`, CSS transitions or
accumulators; animate `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`, `clip-path`; measure in `setup` only.
Mounting: `<div data-st="badge" data-text="v2">` elements are mounted as soon as `define()` runs, even
when the page module defines the component after `index.js` mounted the rest; or call
`Badge('#el', {...})` yourself. A component's DOM is built in `setup`, which runs after CSS and fonts
load, not when the factory returns: `const c = LowerThird(el, {...}); await c.ready;` before touching
its inner elements (`el.querySelector('.st-lt-role')` is null until then).
