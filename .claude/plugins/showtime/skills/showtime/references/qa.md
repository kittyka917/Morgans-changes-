# QA: acceptance checklists and the critic pass

Read this when a video is about to be rendered or delivered: the pre-render and post-render checklists
and the `showtime qa` rules and `expect` block. The critic protocol is in `review.md`.

Nothing ships on "it rendered". Ship on evidence. Run the pre-render list before the final render,
the post-render list on the MP4, then the critic pass. Fix, re-render the affected range, and re-check.
Report failures honestly. Don't retime audio or cut duration to hide a sync problem.

Tools: `showtime check <project>` (runtime errors, overflow, contrast from real pixels, determinism
warnings), `showtime snap <project> --at t1,t2,...` and `--sheet --every 1s` (stills and contact sheets),
`showtime render <project> --preview` (fast draft), `showtime audio meter <file>` (loudness and peaks).
For stream inspection, use the bundled ffprobe (`showtime paths` shows where it is). Never call a bare system `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`.

Batch visual checks: one `showtime look` per phase, not dozens of single frames (`looking.md`).

## Essentials

- Never call a video ready without a `showtime qa` verdict from the current turn, quoted with its numbers, and
  a look at the file (`showtime look <job>`). Ship on evidence, not on "it rendered" (§ Tools)
- Pre-render list, final render, post-render list on the MP4, critic pass; never retime audio or cut duration
  to hide a sync problem (§1, §2, §3)
- The "This video tells ___ that ___" sentence exists and every scene traces to it; hook readable by 0.3 s, first
  change by 2 s, frame 0 neither black nor a logo sting (§1)
- Every claim, number, quote and logo is from the source; label illustrative data; no secrets, internal hostnames
  or real customer or personal data anywhere, share copy included (§1)
- `showtime check <project>`: 0 errors, ends with `phone check: PASS`; contrast ≥4.5:1 (≥3:1 large display) on
  real pixels, mid-transition frames included; no `labels_crowded` (§1)
- Snap `cut − 0.1 s` and `cut + 0.2 s` at every cut; no unplanned 1 s dead zone; ≤3 flashes in any 1 s and
  ≤2 flash frames per video; the final frame is a designed hold (§1)
- No `Date.now`, unseeded `Math.random`, CSS transitions or timers; `--at 3.2,3.2` gives identical images (§1)
- File: H.264 High, `yuv420p`, BT.709 tags, faststart, AAC 48 kHz stereo, duration = `showtime.json` ±1 frame (§2)
- Audio: −14 LUFS ±1 (or the requested target), true peak ≤ −1.0 dBTP, LRA ≤8 LU (≤11 music-first), music
  18–25 dB under the voice; `loudness` WARNs past 1 LU off target, FAILs past 3 LU (§2, § Tools)
- Frame 0 is the thumbnail: a hook complete at t=0 (`"poster": 0`) or a baked poster (`--poster-bake auto`);
  EDL and external videos: `showtime deliver poster <video> --at <t> --bake`. Ship `share.txt` (1–3 sentences,
  no claim not in the video), burned captions for social plus a sidecar, and credits for any CC-BY asset (§2)
- `showtime qa [video|job] [--platform name] [--captions file] [--expect file]`: always name the platform;
  exit 1 on FAIL (`--strict`: also WARN); after a WARN run the "Next command" it prints (§ Tools)
- Size caps (`github`, `chat`, `web`): keep the master, qa the capped export with `--platform github` (§ Tools)
- Captions: ≤2 lines, ≤42 characters a line (32 vertical, 4:5 included), ≤20 characters/s for 3+ word cues, no
  cue under 0.4 s; judge a variant on its own sidecar with `--captions FILE` (§ Tools)
- Phone check floors: 5 pt (16:9), 10 pt (1:1), 11 pt (4:5), 15 pt (9:16); reading time `0.3 s + max(characters
  / cps, words / wps)`, ≥1 s. qa quotes the last `showtime check`, so run check first or it says PARTIAL (§ Tools)
- `frozen` WARNs from 2.5 s without visible change (launch films 3.5 s), FAILs from 6 s. Launch films also WARN
  past 5 hard cuts or 6 scenes in 60 s, a 5.5 s still, and a voiceless mix moving under 3 dB (§ Tools)
- Quality mode (the default), publish-bound or studio work: `showtime review-pack <job>` (qa's "review pending"
  line names it), then `review.md` with the pack's `CRITIC.md`; lean: publish-bound only (§3)
- Quality floor (WARN): player controls in the footage, soft or upscaled footage, stepped caption boxes, a
  small picture in big flat borders; the critic's `WOULD I POST THIS: no` holds delivery in quality mode (§3, § Tools)
- Only a `final*.mp4` is the latest final; promote a variant: `job note <job> --output final=<file>` (§ Tools)

## 1. Pre-render (on the project)

**Story**
- [ ] The "This video tells ___ that ___" sentence exists and every scene traces back to it.
- [ ] The hook is readable by 0.3 s, and the first change happens by 2 s. Frame 0 is not black and not a logo sting.
- [ ] Every claim, number, quote and logo is from the source (story.md §6). Illustrative data is labeled when it could be mistaken for real.
- [ ] No secrets, internal hostnames or real customer or personal data appear anywhere, including in share copy.
- [ ] The distinctness check (story.md §8) passed.

**Text and layout** (sheet at each scene start and midpoint)
- [ ] `showtime check` reports 0 errors. Warnings are read and either fixed or explained.
- [ ] Every text hold meets pacing.md §1 (settled time, not entrance time).
- [ ] Sizes are at or above the floor in typography.md §3. Text sits inside the safe box for every target aspect.
- [ ] `showtime check` ends with `phone check: PASS` (type size in points at phone width, every text held long enough to read,
      nothing under platform UI; the numbers and their sources are under "Phone check" below).
- [ ] Contrast is ≥4.5:1 (≥3:1 for large display) on real pixels, including frames **mid-transition**.
- [ ] No overflow, clipping, collisions or orphaned single-word lines. Nothing sits in the caption band when captions exist.
- [ ] No `labels_crowded` (warning): SVG labels in one graphic (chart values and axes, map names) that touch or sit
      closer than 0.15em side by side or stacked (`label_gap_em` in `runtime/thresholds.json`). Fix: fewer bars
      (aggregate, or label only the highlight and extremes), the chart's default `valueLabels` (auto-thinning, not
      `"all"`), or a larger plot. Seen only while a chart grows or morphs it is a note; the settled frame is judged.
- [ ] There are no off-palette colors and at most 2 font families. All fonts load from local files (no fallback in the check report).

**Motion**
- [ ] Cuts: snapshot at `cut − 0.1 s` and `cut + 0.2 s` for every cut. Elements that continue across a cut match
      in position, scale and color. A crossfade between two busy layouts must not look like a muddy double exposure.
      Stagger it (old out, then new in) or dip through the ground.
- [ ] No dead zones of 1 s or more without motion, unless it's the planned held beat or the final hold.
- [ ] No bounce on text blocks, no looping "breathing" on readable text, and no lingering slow push in the back half of a scene.
- [ ] Flash limit: ≤3 flashes in any 1 s window, and ≤2 flash frames in the whole video.
- [ ] The final frame is a designed hold (logo, CTA), not the tail end of an exit animation.

**Audio plan**
- [ ] Music starts on frame 1 (no silent intro) and ends on a button that lands on the logo (no fade-out mid-phrase).
- [ ] The voice script fits the word budget, and scene durations were synced from the measured voice clips.
- [ ] SFX density matches the tone, with one sound family. The reveal gets an impact, and there is no whoosh on every cut.

**Determinism**
- [ ] No `Date.now`, unseeded `Math.random`, CSS transitions, infinite animations or timers driving visuals
      (`showtime check` warns). Randomness goes through `ST.rand(seed)`/`ST.noise`.
- [ ] Snap the same time twice (e.g. `--at 3.2,3.2`). The two images must be identical.
- [ ] Snap a late time first and then an early one. Seeking backward must give the same image as seeking forward.

## 2. Post-render (on the MP4)

**File**
- [ ] H.264 High, `yuv420p`, BT.709 tags present, faststart, AAC 48 kHz stereo, and the expected width, height and fps.
- [ ] Duration = `showtime.json` duration ±1 frame. Frame count = `round(duration × fps)`. Audio duration within 1 frame of video.
- [ ] Within every target's length and size cap (platforms.md §2).

**Visual** (contact sheet at 1 s intervals + stills at the hook, reveal, each cut, the final second)
- [ ] Frame 0 is the intended poster or hook frame. There are no black or frozen runs over 0.5 s that weren't planned.
  Camera footage of a speaker holding still is not frozen: `qa` samples a long hold and, when every part of the frame keeps
  camera noise and a few places move (lips, blinks, hands) while there is sound, reports it as `held_shot` (INFO) instead;
  the same live picture without sound is a `frozen` WARN. A hold in a project whose page plays no `<video>` is always judged as frozen.
- [ ] No banding in dark gradients when viewed at 200% (color.md §4). No encoding blockiness on grain or fast motion.
- [ ] Brand colors sampled from a flat area are within about 2 levels of the source hex.
- [ ] Text is legible when the sheet is viewed at phone size (about 360 px wide for 16:9, 270 px for 9:16).

**Audio metering** (`showtime audio meter`)
| Measure | Target |
|---|---|
| Integrated loudness | −14 LUFS ±1 (or the requested target) |
| True peak | ≤ −1.0 dBTP |
| Loudness range | ≤8 LU (≤11 for music-first pieces) |
| Voice vs music under it | Music 18–25 dB below the voice. Voice is always intelligible |
| Start | Audio present within the first 0.1 s when music is planned from frame 1 |
| End | Clean button or tail, with no cut-off decay in the last 0.3 s |
- [ ] Listen once on small speakers or earbuds, at least the hook, the reveal and the end. No clicks at edits,
      no harsh sibilance, and no SFX louder than the voice.

**Deliverables**
- [ ] Frame 0 is the thumbnail and flows into frame 1: a hook complete at t=0 (`"poster": 0`), or a poster that
      `showtime render` baked because it looks like the opening (`--poster-bake auto`). `poster.jpg` is the cover to
      upload where a platform takes one. EDL and external videos: `showtime deliver poster <video> --at <t> --bake`
      (then `<video>.poster.mp4` ships). qa WARNs `poster_flash` when frame 0 jumps to a different frame 1.
- [ ] `share.txt` exists, is 1–3 sentences in the video's tone, and contains no claim that isn't in the video.
- [ ] Captions are burned in for social targets, and a sidecar `.srt`/`.vtt` exists where the platform supports one.
- [ ] A credits file ships whenever any CC-BY asset was used (`credits.txt` beside `final.mp4`, or
      `<stem>.credits.txt`; render writes it), and the user has been told to paste it into the description.
- [ ] Platform exports each pass their own caps and safe zones.
- [ ] The report to the user lists paths, actual duration, the angle in one sentence, the contact sheet, and scene ids for targeted changes.

## 3. The critic pass

Every finished video in quality mode (the default; qa prints "review pending" with the command until a round
has a verdict), and publish-bound or studio work in lean mode: `showtime review-pack <job>`, then follow
`review.md`. The critic's
brief is the `CRITIC.md` the pack writes (severity scale, citation rule, answer format, three rounds
at most, pairwise from round 2, the absolute `WOULD I POST THIS` line); do not write a brief of your own. Lean work that is not publish-bound gets
the self-review in `review.md` section 1.

## Tools

The checklists above are judged by eye; these commands produce the evidence. **Do not call a video ready
without a `showtime qa` verdict from the current turn**, quoted with its numbers, and without a look at
the file (`showtime look <job>`, `looking.md`).

**`showtime qa [video|job] [--project dir] [--expect file] [--platform name] [--captions file] [--json]`**
checks the delivered file itself. Given a job (folder or name), or nothing inside a job, it checks the
job's latest final (else its latest draft) and prints `using <path> (latest final)`; an explicit older
file is still checked, with a note naming the newer one. Name the platform whenever there is one:
`--platform`, else showtime.json `expect.platform`, else showtime.json `"platform"`, else the job's
(`showtime job init|note --platform reels`); the output says which (`platform  reels (from job.json)`),
and with none it runs generic checks only (no length or aspect limits).

Which caption files it checks (it prints them; `qa.json` `captions`):
- `--captions FILE` (repeatable): exactly those files, nothing found automatically. Use it to judge a
  variant on its own sidecar (`qa shorts-9x16.mp4 --captions shorts-9x16.ass`).
- In a job folder: the video's own sidecars, `<stem>.srt/.vtt/.ass` beside it (`final.srt` also counts
  for a baked `final.poster.mp4`), plus the job's latest captions (recorded by `edit render`, by
  `showtime captions --srt` into the job folder, or `job note --output captions=<file>`) only when the
  file is the job's latest final or draft, has no sidecar of its own and the captions were made for the
  same aspect (an `.ass` PlayRes, or the video the `.srt` is named after); with no captions recorded, the
  project's own caption files of that aspect. A 9:16 variant or an export never inherits the 16:9 captions.
- Outside a job: `<stem>.*`, `captions.*` / `subs.*` and `captions/` beside the video, and the project's.

Output: PASS / WARN / FAIL lines, each with a rule id, a timestamp, the frame at that time
(`work/qa/<video>/frames/`) and a fix; `qa.json` and `sheet.jpg` (FAIL/WARN frames outlined). Every long
caption line and every too-fast cue is listed (up to 12 each, the rest counted), so one run shows them all.
Exit code 1 on FAIL (`--strict`: also on WARN). When the video sits in a job folder, the verdict is logged
per file in `job.json` (`qa_files`); the job's verdict (`qa`, what `status` and `SHOWTIME.md` show) follows
the job's latest final (else draft) only, so checking an export or a variant never makes the final look
unchecked. After a WARN, "Next command" names the rules to fix first (e.g.
`showtime check <project> --find-first frozen`), then the re-render and `showtime qa <job>`.

Size-capped platforms (`github`, `chat`, `web`, or `expect.max_size_mb`): keep a full-quality master and
deliver a capped copy. When `deliver exports` already wrote one beside the master (`exports/<stem>.github.mp4`,
`<stem>.<N>mb.mp4`) under the cap, the master's `file_size` is INFO and names the command that checks the
export itself (`showtime qa <export> --platform github`); without one it FAILs with the exact
`deliver exports` command.

| Rule | Severity | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `unreadable`, `no_video` | FAIL | ffprobe cannot read the file (or its audio cannot be decoded) / the file has no video stream |
| `odd_dimensions` | FAIL | width or height is odd |
| `codec`, `pix_fmt`, `variable_fps`, `faststart`, `color_tags` | WARN | not H.264 / yuv420p / constant standard fps / moov first / BT.709 tagged |
| `duration` | FAIL | off the expect block (± tolerance) or the project/render length (± 1.5 frames) |
| `no_audio` | WARN (FAIL if `expect.audio`) | no audio stream |
| `audio_codec` | WARN (INFO for a sample rate other than 48 kHz) | the audio codec is not AAC |
| `av_length` | WARN | audio and video lengths differ by more than 1.5 frames (and 0.06 s) |
| `silent_audio` | FAIL | the audio stream is digital silence |
| `loudness` | WARN > 1 LU off target, FAIL > 3 LU | integrated LUFS vs the platform target (default -14) |
| `true_peak` | WARN above ceiling + 0.3, FAIL above 0 dBTP | 8x oversampled true peak |
| `clipping` | FAIL | runs of full-scale samples (a squared-off waveform) |
| `leading_silence` / `trailing_silence` | WARN | sound starts after 0.5 s / the last 2 s are silent |
| `silent_gap` | WARN ≥ 1 s, FAIL ≥ 3 s | silence inside the video |
| `first_frame_black` | FAIL | frame 0 is black (no poster baked) |
| `first_frame_flat` | WARN | frame 0 is one flat colour |
| `poster_flash` | WARN | frame 0 differs sharply from frames 1-2 (a baked poster over an opening that builds from empty): a one-frame flash on autoplay and every loop |
| `poster_mismatch` | WARN | the render's poster still (render.json `poster`) differs from its video frame by more than 4 mean luma levels, or its PNG carries colour chunks (gAMA, cHRM, cICP, iCCP) that make browsers draw it darker than the video |
| `black_segment` | WARN ≥ 0.25 s, FAIL ≥ 1 s | black inside the video (`ends_black`: WARN for a black ending ≥ 1 s) |
| `frozen` | WARN ≥ 2.5 s (launch films, showtime.json `"kind": "launch"`: ≥ 3.5 s, `launch_hold_s`), FAIL ≥ 6 s or half the video | no visible change (a few typed characters or a thin moving line still count as a hold); the thresholds, `freeze_noise_db` included, live in `runtime/thresholds.json`, shared with `showtime check`, so check finds the same holds before the render. A padded or blurred export is judged inside its picture (`<export>.export.json`), not on its bars. See "Dark themes and slow pushes" below |
| `dead_stop` | WARN | a fast move (6+ frames of real change) whose last frames still move at half its peak or more, then nothing for 4+ frames: it lands with no settle. The message names the frame; fix: ease the last 6-10 frames out (`power3.out`, `premium`) or land earlier and hold (st.qa.motion, on the rhythm's frame differences) |
| `held_shot` | INFO | a long hold that is live camera footage with sound (a speaker holding still), not a frozen picture; see the Visual checklist above |
| `final_hold` | INFO ≤ 4 s, WARN above | the ending is a still hold (fine for an end card) |
| `captions_past_end`, `captions_timing` | FAIL | sidecar cues outside the video or reversed |
| `caption_flash` | WARN | cues on screen for under 0.4 s (fast speech split into one-word blinks); the summary prints the shortest cue |
| `captions_overlap`, `caption_lines`, `caption_line_long`, `caption_fast`, `caption_bounds` | WARN | two cues at once, > 2 lines, > 42 characters (32 vertical, 4:5 included), > 20 characters/s (cues of 3+ words), outside the safe box. `showtime captions` and `voice script` write within these same limits |
| `phone_size`, `phone_reading`, `phone_zone` | WARN | the phone check's findings, copied from the project's last `showtime check` with their timestamps (and frames): text under the minimum in points at phone width / on screen for less than it takes to read / under platform UI, a player control strip or at the frame edge. A phone-check failure is a WARN, never a FAIL |
| `phone_unverified` | INFO | qa could not verify type size, reading time or UI zones: no `showtime check` report with a phone block for this project, or it ran at another size. Captions are still judged (below) |
| `captions_missing` | FAIL/WARN | `expect.captions` but no sidecar and no caption text in the check report |
| `captions_empty` | WARN | a caption file has no cues or cannot be read |
| `missing_credits` | FAIL | a mix report or `.license.json` sidecar requires attribution and no credits file (`credits.txt` in any case, `<stem>.credits.txt`, or the job's credits) ships with the video |
| `credits_incomplete` | WARN | the credits file lacks a required line |
| `too_long`, `too_short`, `file_size` | FAIL | outside the platform or expect limits |
| `aspect` | WARN (FAIL for `expect.width/height/aspect`) | aspect differs from the platform |
| `resolution` | WARN | the aspect fits but the frame has under 97 % of the platform's pixels (540x960 for Reels): render the final at full size |
| `upscale` | WARN (INFO when the EDL sets `"output": {"allow_upscale": true}`) | an EDL render enlarged a source more than 1.5x (from `<video>.report.json`, also for a baked `final.poster.mp4` and for exports, which carry the report with factors scaled to their size); the fix names a smaller output size or `--fit blur`, or says when it is unavoidable (1080p to 1080x1920) |
| `player_chrome` | WARN (footage) | a thin bar across over half the width, low in the frame or in a recorded player, with small glyphs at both ends (play, time, fullscreen), in the same place on 2+ sampled frames: a web player's controls recorded with the page |
| `soft_footage` | WARN (footage) | edge sharpness (sum \|Laplacian\| / sum \|gradient\| per detailed 64 px cell, at delivery size) under 0.75 on 60 % of the detailed cells, on half the sampled frames: crisp screen text is ~1.5, a 2x upscale ~1.0, 3x ~0.7. Fix: re-record at 2x device scale |
| `caption_boxes` | WARN | two caption boxes stacked around one centre with widths differing by over 10 % (one box per line: the stepped look), on 2+ sampled frames. Fix: one plate (`captions --style boxed`) |
| `empty_borders` | WARN (footage) | a solid picture filling under 70 % of the frame (width x height) inside flat borders, on over 30 % (and 2+) of the sampled frames |
| `must_show` | FAIL | a must-show text is missing from the on-screen text list of the last `showtime check` |
| `must_show_unverified` | WARN | found only in the project source (run `showtime check`, then `qa` again) |
| `expect_invalid` | WARN | an unknown key in the `expect` block, or an unknown platform name (checked without a platform target) |
| `reference_copy` | FAIL | the render copies a style reference of its job: 25 % of sampled frames match reference frames, or 10 % with the same cut rhythm (`reference.md` section 3) |
| `reference_close` | WARN | 5 % or more of the sampled frames look like reference frames |
| `reference_credit` | WARN | "Style reference: ..." is missing from credits.txt or share.txt (`showtime reference credit <job>`) |
| `edit_choppy` | WARN (launch films) | more than 5 hard cuts in a film of up to 60 s |
| `too_many_scenes` | WARN (launch films) | more than 6 scenes or layouts in up to 60 s |
| `dead_hold` | WARN (launch films) | nothing moves for more than 5.5 s |
| `flat_music` | WARN (launch films without a voice) | the mix's loudness moves less than 3 dB (10th-90th percentile of 0.5 s windows) |

The optional `expect` block in `showtime.json` (or a file passed with `--expect`) states the brief's
measurable targets up front:

```json
"expect": {"duration": 15, "tolerance": 0.5, "platform": "reels", "lufs": -14, "true_peak": -1,
           "audio": true, "captions": true, "max_size_mb": 50,
           "must_show": ["Northwind", {"text": "v2 is here", "at": 3.0, "tol": 1.0}]}
```

Platforms: `youtube x linkedin reels tiktok shorts square` (as in `deliver exports`) plus `web` (silent loop,
15 MB), `github` and `chat` (10 MB), `broadcast` (-23 LUFS).

**Edit rhythm** (`rhythm` in qa.json, one line in the output) is measured for every video up to 3 minutes:
layouts (stretches with one composition) and how each layout change happens (`cut`, `fast`: a push,
wipe or whip under 0.6 s that replaces the frame, `move`: 0.6 s or more of continuous motion: a camera
move, a match, a dissolve), hard cuts, shot lengths, the share of frames where nothing moves and the
longest such stretch, the mix's dynamics, and per planned scene change whether it was a hard cut
and whether the music moves there (an onset or a +1.5 dB rise). It is judged (the four rules above) for
launch, promo, release and trailer films: showtime.json `"kind": "launch"` (the launch template sets it),
`expect.style`, or a job goal that says launch, promo, trailer, teaser or release video. The numbers
come from the premium grammar in `workflows/launch-video.md`.

**Phone check** (the audience complaint: text moves too fast to read and is too small on a phone). One named
check, printed as one line by both tools:

```
phone check: PASS (smallest text 8.1 pt (minimum 5 pt for 16:9); every text held to its reading time at 17 characters/s or 3 words/s (en); nothing under platform UI; captions: 12 cues, longest line 34 characters, fastest 15 characters/s)
phone check: FAIL - type 4.1 pt "Terms apply" at 0:12.4; reading "Sign up today" 0.8s of 2.1s at 0:05.0; under platform UI "Link in bio" at 0:09.0
phone check: PARTIAL (captions: 12 cues, longest line 34 characters; type size, reading time and UI zones need `showtime check <project>` ...)
```

`showtime check` measures it before the render and writes the per-frame findings plus a `phone` block in
`report.json` (aspect, minimum, smallest texts, items with timestamps). `showtime qa` cannot read pixels back
into text, so it quotes that block (`work/check/report.json`) and says PARTIAL when there is none, when it ran at
another size, or when it is older than the project sources; captions are always judged on the sidecar files.
Parts:

| Part | Rule (finding codes) | Limit | Where the number comes from |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reading time | `short_text` | every text (not numbers alone, not `data-caption` text read along with the voice) is on screen for `0.3 s + max(characters / cps, words / wps)`, at least 1 s; per language in `runtime/thresholds.json` `reading`: default 17 characters/s and 3 words/s, `ja` 4 chars/s, `zh` 9, `ko` 12 (no words/s for languages written without spaces). The language is showtime.json `lang`, else `<html lang>`, else `en` | Checked against the published sources on 2026-09-29, no number changed. Netflix timed-text style guides, reading speed for adult programs: English 20 characters/s (17 for children's programs; [en-US](https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/217350977-English-USA-Timed-Text-Style-Guide)), Japanese 4 ([ja](https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767517-Japanese-Timed-Text-Style-Guide); 7 for SDH, no separate children's figure), Simplified Chinese 9 (7 for children's; [zh](https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/215986007-Chinese-Simplified-Timed-Text-Style-Guide)), Korean 12 (9 for children's; [ko](https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/216001127-Korean-Timed-Text-Style-Guide)). So `ja` 4, `zh` 9 and `ko` 12 are exactly the adult limits. The default 17 characters/s is the English children's limit, i.e. deliberately under the adult 20 (on-screen text is read while the picture also moves). 3 words/s = 180 words/min, the top of the BBC's 160-180 wpm recommendation (0.33-0.375 s per word, at least about 0.3 s per word on screen), quoted from the [BBC Subtitle Guidelines](https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/guides/subtitles/) as reproduced on [clevercast.com](https://www.clevercast.com/bbc-subtitling-guidelines/) (the BBC page itself could not be fetched when this was checked); it is about 76 % of the 238 wpm adults read silently (English non-fiction; 260 fiction, 183 aloud): [Brysbaert 2019, Journal of Memory and Language 109, 104047](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2019.104047) (open PDF: [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/linguistics/2019-brysbaert.pdf)). Tune the file, not the code |
| Type size | `tiny_text` | on-screen size in points at phone width: `px x 390 / frame width` (an iPhone 14/15-class screen, the video filling its width in a feed). Minimum by aspect (`phone_min_pt`): 16:9 5 pt, 1:1 10 pt, 4:5 11 pt, 9:16 15 pt; `tiny_text_frac` (2.2 % of the frame height) stays as a second floor, so 1920x1080 needs 25 px, 1080x1920 42 px, 1080x1080 28 px, 1080x1350 31 px. Decor (`data-st-decor`, `{decor: true}`) is exempt. Judged on the median size over the text's life, so an entrance that starts small is not a small text; text under the minimum is one warning per text, grouped when there are many | calibrated on the shipped examples: their smallest 16:9 labels are 5.1-6.5 pt (26-33 px at 1080p), their vertical ones 15.6-15.9 pt, the square one 11.2 pt, so the minimums are the smallest sizes that let the examples pass. That is a floor, not a target: aim for typography.md's floors (36 px at 1080p = 7.3 pt, 48 px at 1080x1920 = 17.3 pt), and `small_text` notes still mark text under ~3.3 % |
| UI zones | `safe_zone`, `edge_margin`, `control_strip` | frames taller than wide (9:16, 4:5): text inside x 64-916, y 220-1440 at 1080x1920 (platforms.md §3, scaled); landscape and square: not within 3 % of an edge, and no small text in the bottom 8 % (player controls) | platforms.md §3, typography.md §6 |
| Captions | `caption_line_long`, `caption_fast`, `caption_flash`, `caption_lines`, `caption_bounds` (qa, on the sidecar) | at most 2 lines, 42 characters per line (32 vertical), 20 characters/s for cues of 3+ words, no cue under 0.4 s, inside the safe box (`st/captions_rules.py`, shared with the writers) | subtitle practice as above; the summary line quotes the cue count, the longest line and the fastest cue |

`--no-timeline` skips reading time (the line says so); type size and zones come from the sample frames then.
Burned-in captions that are drawn as page text (`data-caption`) get the type-size and zone checks like any text,
but not the reading-time rule (they follow the voice).

**Quality floor** (`st/qa/floor.py`). Four looks-cheap patterns that pass every technical check: the four
rows above from `player_chrome` on, measured on 3-10 frames sampled across the video (grey, at delivery size up to
1920 px wide). They are WARNs only, tuned to stay quiet on designed frames (a title on a flat ground, a divider
line, one caption plate); the thresholds are constants at the top of the file. `player_chrome`, `soft_footage`
and `empty_borders` run only when the video may hold footage (not for a project whose page plays no `<video>`),
and a padded export is judged inside its picture. `qa.json` `floor` has the counts.

**Dark themes and slow pushes.** Black and frozen stretches are measured on absolute pixel change, so two
honest designs can trip them:
- `black_segment` on a dark theme: a near-black ground (#0b0b0f and similar) counts as black. A 0.25-1 s
  WARN where a crossfade lands on the empty ground is usually real dead air; start the incoming content
  earlier (or on the cut) rather than lightening the ground.
- `frozen` on a slow push or drift over dark frames: an 8 % push over 7 s, eased at both ends, changes
  dark pixels too little in its slow ends. Look at the two frames the finding names (or
  `showtime snap <video> --at <start>,<end>`): if the framing visibly moved, the hold is a slow camera
  move, not a still; either speed the move (or drop the ease on the long side), add a moving element, or
  accept the WARN knowingly (`showtime job note <job> --verified "frozen at 12.4 s is a slow push"`).
  A typing beat on a still terminal is a real hold; give it a cursor or a camera move.

**`showtime check <project>`** also audits canvas films through `Film.frameInfo()` (text off frame, safe
zone, overlap, contrast against the surrounding pixels, fonts, reading time), flags `Math.random()` during
playback (`unseeded_random`), and records every on-screen text with its first/last time in
`report.json` (`texts`), which `qa` uses for `must_show`. Extra modes:
- `--determinism`: 12 probe frames plus a second page load; frame hashes land in `report.json`.
- `--find-first black|frozen|nondeterministic|error [--from s --to s --min s]`: bisects to the first bad
  frame and saves it with the last good one (see `debugging-renders.md`).

**`showtime review-pack [job|video]`** (a job means its latest final) builds the critic's folder (`review/round-N/`: sheets, key and scene
frames, loudness graph, qa run, context copies, `CRITIC.md` with the eight judging questions). Scene
frames follow the planned scenes: showtime.json `"scenes"`, then `"chapters"`, then a film's `CUE.acts`
(every `key: number` pair in `CUE` counts), then the page's scene clips (`<section>` / `.scene` clips when
there are two or more, else top-level clips minus overlays: a clip shown inside another clip's window, an
open-ended layer under later clips, or `data-overlay`), `voice/timeline.json` slots or the EDL report; only
without any of these does it detect cuts in the pixels. It prints `(N scenes, M cuts, from <source>)`; the
manifest has `scenes_source`. Its fresh qa run uses `--platform`/`--lufs` when given, else the ones the last
`showtime qa` of the same file was given (a -16 LUFS tutorial stays judged at -16). For an edit render, qa judges loudness against what the render report says it was mastered to (-14 by default; a kept source level is noted, not failed). The protocol is in
`review.md`.

**Which render is the job's latest final.** `showtime qa <job>`, `review-pack <job>` and `deliver` use the
job's latest final. A render, `edit render`, `captions --burn` or `deliver poster --bake` inside a job
becomes it when the file is an `.mp4` named `final*` (or a derived copy of the current final, e.g.
`launch.poster.mp4` of `launch.mp4`); `render --job` always writes such names. Anything else (an alpha
`.webm`/`.mov` overlay, `bumper.mp4`, a second aspect named `shorts-9x16.mp4`) is logged as a variant and
the output says how to promote it: `showtime job note <job> --output final=<file>`. Check a variant with
`showtime qa <file>` (plus `--captions` for its own sidecar).

Planted-defect fixtures in `tests/fixtures/defects/` prove each rule fires; add one before adding a rule.
